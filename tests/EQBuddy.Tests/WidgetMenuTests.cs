/// 2026-09-08 ~2:13 PM CT with the owner's ~2:15 PM CT Guide amendment. The widget's
/// context menu is ONE menu hanging off the shared root border, so before this cut every
/// row on it was also on the minimized bar — eleven rows over a fullscreen game, of which

///
/// **The failure this refuses is the quiet one.** A row added to `MainWindow.xaml` without
/// `Tag="expanded"` is an extra item on the minimized menu that compiles, runs, photographs
/// as an ordinary menu (trap 29) and breaks no other test — the exact shape of the "a
/// guard that forbids the wrong thing cannot see a missing thing" pairing trap 34 names, so
/// this file asserts BOTH directions: the four that must be there, and that nothing else is.
///
/// **It parses the XAML rather than launching the app** for the reason `RetiredCardsTests`
/// already reads the same file: the WPF layer has no unit test project (docs/TestPlan.md
/// §5), the menu is declarative, and what can go wrong here is a declaration. That the
/// declaration is APPLIED at runtime is a different claim and a different guard — trap 42 —
/// and it is `ShellHostTests`' `menuRows` dump fact from a launched app.
