/// A settings save writes the WHOLE object from a snapshot taken at load. Anything that
/// changed the file since then is reverted — every setting at once, no error, nothing on
/// screen. That is precisely how joma65's hide tick-boxes behaved in #169, and until now
/// it was indistinguishable from a bug in the saving itself.
///
/// It cannot be repaired at this layer (an AppSettings has no idea which of its two
/// hundred properties the user meant to change), so the goal here is narrower and
/// sufficient: it must stop being invisible, so the next report says which of the two it
/// is instead of leaving us guessing.
///
/// These tests write settings.json inside the throwaway profile TestProfileIsolation
/// hands every test — and that profile is ONE directory for the whole assembly, which is
/// why the collection below exists.
///
/// **This file used to claim "no other test in the suite touches that file". It was not
/// true, and saying it instead of enforcing it cost a 1-in-3 flake** in
/// <c>LoadCanBeAskedNotToPersistMigrations</c> — the guard Fable 5 asked for in the
/// v1.99.3 release review, flaky from the day it shipped. `CompanionHost` and
/// `OutputfileAutoImport` both call `settings.Save()`, their tests run in a different
/// xUnit collection, and collections run in PARALLEL: so a default settings.json landed
/// on top of the two-byte file this test had just written, and the assertion that nothing
/// wrote it failed against a real write by a real writer. Trap 34's shape exactly — a
/// comment standing in for a guard reads as coverage.
