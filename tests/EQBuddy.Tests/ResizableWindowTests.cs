/// Which pop-out windows the player can resize, and — the load-bearing half — WHY each
/// exclusion is an exclusion.
///
/// David, 2026-08-25: *"please work on allowing all the pop out windows to be resized."*
/// "All" turned out to have three real exceptions, and without this list the next reader
/// finds a window that does not resize and cannot tell a decision from an oversight. Same
/// curated-must-list shape as `DeadSettingTests.Known` and
/// `GameCommandsTests.SurfacesNeedingACommand` (trap 34): a rule with no enumerated
/// exceptions grows silent ones.
///
/// **The deciding question is where the window's SIZE comes from**, not whether resizing
/// would be nice:
/// - Nothing else owns it, and the content is complete at first render → `AllowResize`,
///   which gives minimum sizes and a remembered size.
/// - Something else already owns it → leave it alone. Two writers for one value is trap 4,
///   and `WindowZoom` says so about Width in its own doc comment.
/// - Something ELSE about it is unresolved → excluded with the reason named.
///
/// **Updated 2026-08-25:** `AllowResize` no longer pins the height at `ContentRendered`. It
/// follows the content until the player grabs a resize border (WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN), which is
/// why Item info's exclusion is now only about its own async body rather than about the pin.
