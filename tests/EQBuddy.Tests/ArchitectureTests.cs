        // Then lowered 4355 → 4324 on 2026-08-19 with the PROGRESS THEME (docs/Themes.md):
        // RenderRaids left for RaidsCardView.cs and the other four Progress-theme cards
        // stopped being fields here entirely, since ProgressWindow builds its own.
        //
        // **Only 31 lines, and the small number is the honest part.** The fold removed

        // decision itself went to `UI.Shared/LegacyPlatformUpdatePolicy` and is unit
        // tested there, which is exactly what the message above asks for; what is left is
        // window plumbing that cannot leave without moving the update banner, and moving
        // the update banner is precisely what Phase 0 was told not to do.

        // `if (env) Loaded += … call a method`, sharing one job and owing nothing to the

        // afterwards, and a tombstone that costs ten lines is cheaper than the next session
        // re-deriving why `_questsHost` has no card. `QuestsThemeCard.cs` (97 lines) and

        // the card build block, the widget's own `TravelsView` field and construction, the
        // `EQBUDDY_EXPAND` member, the SectionMap row, the `_worldCard` field, the render

        // **the ratchet failed the change**, which is the only reason anyone measured.
        //
        // That is the guard doing a job it was not obviously written for. Cut 1's own note
        // above already said "the honest number is 19 lines, and it is much smaller than
        // the deletion" because half of what left came back as commentary; here the same
        // habit went past break-even. The tombstones stayed — a cut that cannot be found
        // afterwards is what CLAUDE.md's "three ways back" and trap 55 both refuse — but
        // they were compressed to a line or two each, with the reasoning kept HERE and in
        // the surface files rather than repeated at every call site. `WorldThemeCard.cs`
        // (60 lines) left the repo outright and is not in this sum; so did

        // had ZERO headroom when the pass started — 4,516 against 4,516.6 — which is why
        // the collapsed HUD bar left rather than being edited in place. `HudBarView.cs`
        // took the chip builder, the divider trim and the per-tick rebuild; what stayed
        // is WHEN the bar is on screen, which is the host's (trap 15). It is a VIEW CLASS
        // and not a `MainWindow.Hud.xaml.cs` partial, because this glob SUMS its matches
        // on purpose and a partial would have bought nothing.
        //
        // Bumped down to the MINIMUM that fits the MERGED tree (3964 × 1.1 = 4360
        // against 4,360 lines), by the same "one line and no more" rule as every entry
        // above. Cut 2 landed on `main` while this branch was in flight and the two
        // changes touch different parts of the file, so the number is the one the MERGE
        // produces rather than either branch's own — which is also why it is set once,
        // here, instead of per commit.
        // 3964 → 3895 on 2026-09-05 (Surface A / SA-2). **A DELETION this time, not a
        // lift**, which is the better of the two and the one this ratchet exists to buy:
        // `SpawnChipsWindow` and `MezChipsWindow` folded into one HUD chip row, and their
        // two construction blocks, the `CloseChips` teardown, the two window fields and
        // the four chip-BUILDING helpers (`MezChips`, `SlowChips`, `FightChips`,
        // `SlowChipsVisible`) left with them — the builders into `UI.Shared/HudChipRow.cs`,
        // where the mez numbering that had never been assertable now is, and the rest into
        // `HudChipRowWindow`.
        //
        // The entry had zero headroom AGAIN when the pass started (4,360 against 3964 ×
        // 1.1 = 4,360), exactly as F2 predicted, which is why SA-2's scope was two window
        // deletions rather than an edit that squeezes under the bar. Set to the MINIMUM
        // that fits, by the same "one line and no more" rule as every entry above:
        // 3895 × 1.1 = 4,284.5 against 4,284 lines.
