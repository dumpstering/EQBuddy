/// error — it is a surface that arrives empty on a paired phone, which nobody finds
/// without a phone, a second machine and the right camp.
///
/// That is not hypothetical: <c>Raids</c> and <c>Progress</c> were added five days after
/// the record, and a wiring written from an older mental model of it would have shipped
/// without them and looked complete.
///
/// **Ported here from <c>EQBuddy.Avalonia.Tests/CompanionWiringTests</c> (E-2a), and it
/// changes lanes on the way.** That test constructed the Avalonia widget and asked the
/// live object which properties were still null — a stronger check, on the lane that is
/// being removed. The WPF widget cannot be constructed in a toolkit-free test project
/// (docs/TestPlan.md §5: no test project references it), so the port is a source scan in
/// the shape <see cref="CompanionSnapshotArgumentTests"/> already uses. **The lane that actually serves phones had NO check of this at all**, so
/// the port is worth more than the assertion it replaces even though it can see less.
///
/// It reads the record by REFLECTION rather than from a list of names, for the reason the
/// original gave: a member added to <see cref="CompanionSources"/> and forgotten fails
/// here, at the moment the gap is created, instead of on a tablet weeks later.
