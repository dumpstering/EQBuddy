///  1. **The policy itself**, as arithmetic, including the negative that keeps it from being

///  2. **The HUD block's application of it**, read out of the SOURCE — the WPF layer has no
///     unit tests (docs/TestPlan.md §5), so the only thing a test can see is that each
///     paragraph really arrived on an ⓘ and really left the body, and that the two that were
///     deliberately kept are still printed.
///
/// **Point 2 is the one this file exists for.** A conversion that DELETED a paragraph instead
/// of moving it looks identical in every screenshot, in every build and in a diff nobody
/// re-reads sentence by sentence — the same shape as trap 26's missing writer, with copy
/// instead of a handler. Every row below was checked against the pre-conversion tree.
