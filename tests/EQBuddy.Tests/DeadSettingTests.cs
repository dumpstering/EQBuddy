/// <summary>
/// A setting that only READERS touch is the signature of a lost capability.
///
/// It has cost three player-facing bugs, each looking like something different:
///
///  * <c>SkyQuestCompleted</c> — you could not tell EQBuddy you had turned a Plane of Sky
///    reward in (#204, #209). Fixed 1.92.0.
///  * <c>EpicQuestCompleted</c> — "Epic complete" had no writer anywhere, and the helper
///    that did the work had passing tests and NO CALLER (#210). Fixed 1.93.0.
///  * <c>SkyQuestClass</c> — EQBuddy Mobile scoped its whole Sky list by it, so a value
///    last saved before 2026-08-16 filtered the phone forever and nothing could change it
///    (#212). Fixed 1.93.2.
///
/// Every one of them came from the same event: a surface was folded into another, the
/// DATA survived the move and the WRITE path did not. No test and no ratchet could see
/// it, because everything still compiled and every existing test still passed.
///
/// So this is the ratchet for that class of bug. It scans the source for settings that are
/// read and never written, and holds the result to a known list with a reason on each
/// entry. A NEW writer-less setting fails the build; removing one means deleting its line.
///
/// **What it cannot see:** a collection mutated through a helper that takes it by
/// reference (<c>BuffSetStore.Add(settings.BuffSetsByClass, …)</c>) looks writer-less
/// here. Those live in the list with that as their reason rather than being special-cased,
/// because a heuristic that tried to spot them would also start hiding real ones.
