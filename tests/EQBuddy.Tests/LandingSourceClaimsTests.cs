/// DRA-67. The landing page's hero pill read "Log-only — reads your /log file, nothing
/// else" — on the most-read line of the most public surface the project has — while the
/// SAME page handed the player a copy button for an /outputfile command whose dump we
/// read. There are four such dumps (<see cref="GameCommands"/>), so the claim was not a
/// rounding error; and nothing caught it because no test had ever opened
/// <c>site/index.html</c>.
///
/// DRA-68 widened it to the repo's FRONT DOOR. The landing's own footer links
/// <c>README.md</c> and <c>EQBuddy-Evolved.md</c>, so correcting only the page walked a
/// reader who checks us from a corrected surface straight onto an uncorrected one —
/// <c>README.md</c> said "Log-only, by principle … it knows only what your own log says"
/// and <c>EQBuddy-Evolved.md</c> carried the literal sibling of the §08 card. A guard that
/// reads one of three surfaces is a guard against one third of the claim.
///
/// DRA-87 took the last three, and they are a DIFFERENT SHAPE — labels over prose that was
/// already true, which is why two honesty cards walked past them. <c>PRODUCT.md</c>'s
/// "### Log-only and local-first" and the v2 charter's "## 2.2 Log-only and local-first"
/// each head a bullet list where every bullet is correct ("no game-memory reads", "no
/// packet inspection"); <c>SECURITY.md</c>'s "EQBuddy's rule is log-only, zero telemetry"
/// is a true statement about EGRESS wearing the wrong noun. Nothing under the heading was
/// wrong, and the heading is the part a reader quotes back at you. The chain is the same
/// one, a link further: <c>EQBuddy-Evolved.md</c>'s own intro points at <c>PRODUCT.md</c>
/// BY NAME for "the product identity in full".
///
/// Six surfaces now, and two columns of <see cref="Surfaces"/> differ by decision rather
/// than convenience — which surface must ENUMERATE the dumps, and which boundary line each
/// must keep while being corrected (<see cref="SecurityBoundary"/>).
///
/// The negative below cannot see a MISSING thing (trap 34), so it is paired with a
/// must-list that is DERIVED from <see cref="GameCommands"/> rather than written here:
/// a fifth /outputfile dump reddens this test until the enumerating surfaces name it,
/// which is the only version of this guard that survives the next command being added.
///
/// DRA-89 then closed the gap that widening left. DRA-87 put a list into the v2 charter's
/// ACCURACY-001 table that enumerates the dumps and cites <c>GameCommands</c> BY NAME — into
/// the one surface the table tells to take the short form. So the only list in that change
/// naming the producer as its authority was the only list nothing checked against it. See
/// <see cref="OutputFilesRowViolations"/>, and the note there on why the row is checked
/// where it is written rather than by flipping the surface's flag.
///
/// The checks are factored through <see cref="Violations"/> so the pre-DRA-67 wording can
/// ride along as a committed negative — green-only is vacuous coverage, and the wording
/// this exists to forbid is the honest fixture to prove-fail against.
