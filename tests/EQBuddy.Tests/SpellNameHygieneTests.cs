/// **A shipped spell NAME must be a token the game can put on a log line.**
///
/// PR #407's audit measured what the alternative costs. `BuffDurations.json` carried the
/// eqlwiki page TITLE `Shield of Thorns (Spell)` — disambiguated because the wiki also has
/// an item of that name — and <see cref="SpellCatalog.BaseName"/> strips a trailing roman
/// rank and nothing else, so the log's `Shield of Thorns V` could never meet it. That one
/// row disabled four mechanisms at once: the landing never resolved, Spell Casting
/// Reinforcement was gated on `resolved` so it never reached the spell, the learned-duration
/// lookup is keyed on the resolved label, and fade-learn is gated on a single candidate. The
/// owner's chip read 15:00 on all 28 landings of a damage shield his own log measures at
/// ~24 minutes, for as long as the row shipped.
///
/// It was a CLASS, not a row: four names across three catalogs. Nothing could see it —
/// the JSON is valid, the loader is happy, every buff test passed, and an unresolved
/// landing renders as a perfectly ordinary chip with the line's label on it. This is
/// trap 30's shape (**a curated field whose FORMAT nothing checks**), one level over from
/// trap 66's `EveryShippedPlaceholderSegmentIsAWholeMobName`.
///
/// The generator half is `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/spellnames.py`, which strips the two
/// disambiguator shapes we have seen so a regenerate cannot re-introduce them. This is the
/// other half, and the division is deliberate (trap 48's move): **strip what is known,
/// refuse the whole class.** A third shape the harvest has never met fails here rather
/// than shipping silently.
