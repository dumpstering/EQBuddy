# Channel archive — 2026-Q3

**Immutable. Nothing here is live, and nothing here is a work queue.**

Rotated out of the active channel files in five passes: **2026-09-14** by DRA-75
(M0-2) under the DRA-73 plan rev 2 approved by David on 2026-09-14,
**2026-09-17** by DRA-165 (DRA-144 F1) under DRA-26 plan §5 as David SIGNed it
2026-09-17T01:06:45Z, and **2026-09-18** by DRA-154 (`EXO-CHANNEL-ROTATE`) under the
Helm AUTHORIZE of that evening, and **2026-09-20** by DRA-229 (DRA-144 F4b) and
DRA-231 (DRA-144 F6), both under DRA-26 plan rev 3 section 5.
`exo-experiment: channel-rotation`. Tier T1.
Pass 2 appended into the existing `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` archive and pass 3 into the
existing `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` one; neither moved anything an earlier pass had written,
and passes 4 and 5 wrote new `SCRIBE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` archives that no earlier
pass had opened. **2026-09-23** appended a second SCRIBE pass into the existing
`SCRIBE.md` archive (the #710+#690 intake had spent the grandfather band); it did
not rewrite anything an earlier pass had written.

Holds live in [`HANDOFF.md`](../../../../../HANDOFF.md) and **Dranak lifts one** (or the Founder where the consequence list applies). An archived line never
revives a hold and never commissions work. If you are looking for something to
do, the inboxes are `SCRIBE.md`, `BEVEL.md` and `FABLE.md` — not this directory.

**Do not append here.** Append to the active file at the repo root.

| [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) *(pass 5)* | 143 | 595,476 | 676,431 B → 85,238 B (18 blocks) | before 2026-09-17, **plus a hand-triaged floor** |
| [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) *(pass 6)* | 10 | 42,706 | 55,411 B → 13,383 B (STATE + 1 tip) | DRA-294 arm (c) discharge floor (32,768 B); hand-triaged, not a date cut |
| [`HANDOFF-legacy.md`](HANDOFF-legacy.md) *(DRA-146 retire, 2026-09-23)* | whole file | 248,286 | 248,286 B → one-line pointer | **retired, not rotated** — Helm SIGN (a) on PR #836; verbatim move, blob `026b6265`, last written `c821ddda` 2026-08-31 |

No pending ask is archived in any pass — pass 2's 18 candidate ask/hold
markers were each dispositioned before the move and all 18 were already discharged,
so nothing needed re-pinning, and pass 3 did the same for 43.
**Pass 5 is the first pass that had to re-pin, and the marker sweep is not what caught
it.** All five 2026-09-14 blocks carrying an `exo-experiment:` tag are correctly archived
as history, but the tag itself is read out of the *live* file by `Get-Experiments` in
`scripts/exo-metrics.ps1` and by two tests, so archiving all six tags broke the ExO
dashboard's regenerability. Both channel guards were green; CI tests caught it. The six
tag lines and their judging clauses are re-pinned verbatim into a dated `STANDING` block
in the live file (3,440 B), and the full entries stay here. **The lesson for pass 6 and
later: the never-rotate floor is a keyword set, so it cannot see content whose liveness is
carried by a consumer rather than by a marker. Grep `scripts/` and `tests/` for the
ledger's filename before cutting it.**
**Pass 5 is also the first pass whose triage changed the cut.** `DECISIONS.md` had 30 blocks
older than the 2026-09-17 date cut carrying a `LIVE ASK` / `PARK` / `HOLD` / `STANDING`
marker. Each was dispositioned by hand: 24 moved — the marker was product vocabulary
(a parked HUD chip row, a seat-mutex holder), a counterfactual ("could have gone the
other way: LIVE ASK first"), a narrative reference to an ask whose residence is another
file and which is now discharged, or a rule that has since graduated to a live document
— and **6 were kept in the live file at any age** because they carry a park with an
unmet reopen condition, an unfixed defect named for veto, a rule whose only residence
is `DECISIONS.md` itself, or a relay another card is still blocked on.
**Pass 4 could not use a cutoff at all.** `SCRIBE.md` is an inbox, not a dated ledger:
its entries carry a `Priority` field, 42 of the 92 were still open by that field, and the
oldest of those (`waiting`, 2026-08-19) sit further down than entries already discharged.
A date cut would have archived live `must-fix` player-facing defects, so pass 4 partitioned
per entry by Priority instead: `someday` / `taken` / `done` and the terminal dispositions
moved, and **zero** entries marked `must-fix`, `approved`, `authorized`, `authorized-next`,
`open` or `waiting` were archived - a count measured over the archive file, not a claim.  The live
`HELM-FEEDBACK.md` asks are still in the active file; the **PR #606** DRA-71 D9 ask
that was unsigned when pass 1 ran has since been SIGNED and moved in pass 3.
**SCRIBE pass 2 (2026-09-23, on PR #733)** is a later append into the same archive,
not a rewrite of pass 4. The #710 and #690 intakes are live `someday` blocks and
stayed in the active file. What moved were `waiting` blocks whose dates are all
before 2026-09-01, undated `waiting` blocks, the terminal `/consider` rarity block
(`BUILT`), and the Avalonia breakout note. `must-fix`, `approved`, `authorized`,
`authorized-next` and `open` stayed at any age, and so did every `waiting` block
dated 2026-09-01 or later. The grandfather row in `scripts/channel-size-baseline.psd1`
was lowered to the measured 79,897 B in the same commit; it was not raised, and it
was not deleted, because 79,897 B is still over the 64 KiB ceiling.

**Pass 6 (DRA-294, 2026-09-21) is the first pass driven by a discharge floor rather than a
size trigger.** Helm's DRA-282 Q2 item 4 ruling (tip PR #773) fixed the arm (c) bar at
**32,768 B** (50% of the 65,536 B ceiling) — shape alone no longer discharges a row. Ten
blocks moved (2026-09-19: `DRA-199`, `DRA-180 D2`, `DRA-180 D3`; 2026-09-17: `DRA-164
D1–D3`, `DRA-149 D5`, `DRA-149 D4`, `DRA-149 D2`, `DRA-164 D4`, `DRA-181 D4`, `DRA-180
D1`), each hand-checked against the file's own never-rotate floor and found to carry no
open ask, unexpired PARK/HOLD or standing rule resident in `DECISIONS.md` itself. **One
close call, kept rather than moved on a margin call:** `DRA-161`'s "Helm LOCK stays live"
entry (2026-09-17) records a standing rule that has since graduated into a live, current
restatement in `HELM.md` ("Soft/Planner may Soft file a fresh amended DRA-55 plan") — by
the pass-5 criteria that would be archivable — but nothing forced its removal to meet the
32,768 B floor (13,383 B landed, 19,385 B of headroom), so it stayed under the never-rotate
floor rather than being risk-judged out on a margin no byte budget required spending.
**Undocumented gap this pass inherited, not created:** DRA-281 (2026-09-21, PR #762) rotated
`DECISIONS.md` 86,981 B → 55,411 B and appended 459 lines to this archive file without adding
a row here or updating the passage above — that PR's own commit message and the live
`DECISIONS.md` "Last cut" line are the record of it; this README's pass count and the passage
above were not amended by it and are not amended here either, since backfilling another
pass's documentation is outside this card's scope.

### Pass 3 rotated the state file itself, which the first two could not

Passes 1 and 2 moved feedback ledgers. Pass 3 is the first rotation of the **`HELM.md`
class** — the file that holds the holds — and that is why its cut is drawn where it is.
**A hold, an open ask and a standing rule do not rotate at any age**, so the live file
keeps its Holds block (empty, which is a live fact and not an omission), its Wakes and
Claude-kick block, its five retired-hold lines, its item shape and its "What Helm does
NOT decide" section, whatever their date. What moved was rulings, plus a pile of 122
`### PR #…` sign-off entries that had accumulated *underneath* the retired-hold lines
and were never holds themselves.

Two live rulings sat below the calendar cutoff, so the live file carries a pointer block
naming them and where to read them in full rather than relying on a reader's memory:
the **PR #685** whole-sequence SIGN (DRA-180/181) and the **PR #684** Jr/Sr router SIGN
(DRA-179). A rotation that silently moves the authorization the top of the file rests on
is technically a move and practically a loss.

Pass 3 also discharged both grandfather rows in `scripts/channel-size-baseline.psd1`
in the same pull request, which is what `scripts/channel-size-guard.ps1` check C requires
and the only way a row ever leaves that table. It used explicit line ranges and a
reconstruction assertion rather than `scripts/channel-rotate.py`, because Helm had
refused the stock `rotate --apply` for these two files on 2026-09-17.

### Four files, and which one to read

- **`HELM.md`** — every Helm ruling before 2026-09-18, in two blocks.
- **`HELM-FEEDBACK.md`** — the readable recovery. **This is the one you want.**
- **`HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md`** — the verbatim 4.93 MB that was
  removed: two ~2.4 MB lines of cp437 mojibake. Unreadable on purpose. It is
  here so "nothing was lost" can be checked **against the bytes** instead of
  taken on trust, and so `channel-wipe-guard`'s ARCHIVE exemption can see the
  entries that moved. Do not try to read it; do not edit it.
- **`FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`** — a straight date rotation of an uncorrupted file, so
  it needs no counterpart.

### None of the three gets repaired — including the mojibake (ruled 2026-09-17)

All three files carry mojibake: ~57k cp437 occurrences in the flattened one, 5,429 cp1252 in
`HELM-FEEDBACK.md`, 1,527 in `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`. They are **OUT of scope for repair, permanently** —
ruled on DRA-160 and recorded with its byte evidence in `DECISIONS.md` (DRA-161). The "do not edit it"
above was written for the flattened file alone, and that gap is exactly what let the card be raised.
One reason each, and they are three different reasons:

- **`HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md`** — corrupt on purpose: it is the checkability exhibit
  described above and the only clean-checkout fixture the cp437 detector has.
- **`HELM-FEEDBACK.md`** — from offset 5,808 to end it is the `f4af3b5f` blob carried verbatim, and all
  5,429 of its markers are inside that region, so repairing them breaks both the verbatim claim below
  and what `channel-rotate.py verify` asserts — while git keeps the same markers in that blob anyway.
- **`FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`** — its marker count is identical to the pre-rotation blob's. Rotation moved
  those bytes; it did not create them.

**The rule behind all three:** a rotated archive copy is not an independent site of corruption. Rotation
is a one-way move of bytes already immutable in git, so repairing the copy removes nothing from the
record — it only makes the archive diverge from the revisions it was cut from. Repair pays on the live
files at the repo root, and that work is done (DRA-55, DRA-119). It never pays here.

The DRA-55 Helm LOCK — *"Soft LEAVE inventing archive repair without separate Helm ruling."* — **stays
live.** The ruling above declines to seek repair; it does not lift the LOCK. Wanting these files
repaired later still needs a real, separate Helm ruling.

[Helm decode / DRA-330: the relay substitution reads as **No archive repair without separate Helm ruling.**
The LOCK forbids archive repair without a separate Helm ruling. It is not a permission to repair. Readable
authority is this gloss, not the quoted comment.]

### The DRA-132 relay corruption is in these files too — measured 2026-09-22, quarantined (DRA-327)

Helm **RULE / DRA-327** (2026-09-22 ~5:00 AM CT, PR #815) ruled **Q3(b)**: this directory stays
**byte-identical**, and the DRA-232 re-pin's byte-for-byte promise **stands**. This note is the
quarantine that ruling ordered. **No byte of any rotated file here was changed by the repair question** — the counts
below were taken by reading the blobs, at the shas named in the table.

**Two of those eleven shas are no longer the sha on `main`, and the note originally claimed they all
were.** Neither is a hole in Q3(b), and both are recorded in full under *Second dated measurement*
after the table. In short: this README is the directory index, not a rotated channel file, and writing
this note changed it; and `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` grew by a **rotation**, which is the archive doing its job.
A rotation appends bytes that were already immutable in git upstream — it does not create corruption,
and it is not the repair Q3(b) declined. **No rotated file has ever been edited in place.**

The defect is the one DRA-132 names: the Founder-chat to Paperclip relay drops negations at rest,
substituting a stock phrase where a negation belongs, so a prohibition quoted verbatim **permits what
it forbids**. DRA-327 established that the substitution has a **second, shorter form**, and that the
marker every earlier count used is a superstring of it — so every count in that family before
2026-09-22 was blind to the short form *by construction, not by error*.

The two literal marker strings are deliberately **not** written in this file. This README is itself a
row in the table below, and quoting the markers here would falsify its own counts the moment this note
landed. They are stated once, with the counting rule that keeps the two forms disjoint, in the
founder-lock-copies README in the dranakcorps-ops repo (rule 1, "Measurement basis").

| file | bytes | blob | short form | long form |
|---|--:|---|--:|--:|
| `HELM.md` | 1,146,639 | `c1fc3ecf` | **627** | **6,090** |
| `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` (pre-DRA-329 rev) | 2,259,556 | `bde941af` | 171 | 256 |
| `HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md` | 4,926,243 | `fef3a1f9` | 223 | 86 |
| `DECISIONS.md` | 671,370 | `d4cb1579` | 10 | 4 |
| `FABLE.md` | 472,049 | `5cf10863` | 2 | 0 |
| `SCRIBE.md` | 100,221 | `8b5a60fd` | 2 | 1 |
| `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` | 1,281,304 | `fe141761` | 1 | 2 |
| `README.md` (this file, pre-note rev) | 17,146 | `8833cb5b` | 0 | 1 |
| `BEVEL.md` | 222,075 | `40e6e767` | 0 | 0 |
| `BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md` | 465,275 | `4efc2ebe` | 0 | 0 |
| `SCRIBE-FEEDBACK.md` | 77,353 | `d6564dd7` | 0 | 0 |
| **total** | **11,639,231** | | **1,036** | **6,440** |

**DRA-327 measured only the first row.** The card was raised on `HELM.md` alone — 627 and 6,090 — and
those two figures are exactly reproduced here. The other ten rows are new: **six further files in this
directory carry the corruption**, and no count in the DRA-132 family had ever looked at them. That is
what this note exists to stop being true.

#### Second dated measurement — 2026-09-22 ~11:30 UTC, after DRA-329's rotation

The table above is a measurement at named blobs and stands as one. Two of its rows are no longer the
revision on `main`, so a reader checking it against the live tree will find two mismatches. Both are
accounted for here rather than by rewriting the rows, per the widened basis's own rule: *a recount is a
second dated measurement, not a verdict on the first.*

| row | measured at | now on `main` | what moved it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` | blob `bde941af`, 2,259,556 B | blob `d8f00162`, 2,318,245 B | **DRA-329 rotation**, PR #816, merged 2026-09-22T10:45:37Z |
| `README.md` (this file) | blob `8833cb5b`, 17,146 B | moves on every edit to it — commits `08be70cf` (this note), `c99267f0` (the DRA-330 gloss), and the one carrying this correction | its own text |

**The shas are not all the same kind.** Every sha in the eleven-row table above, and in the
`measured at` and `now on main` columns here, is a **blob** sha — read it with `git/blobs/{sha}`,
not `commits/{sha}`. The two in this file's own row are **commit** shas, because a file that moves by
its own text has no settled blob to cite; they name the commits that moved it. A blob sha returns 422
as a commit and a commit sha 422s as a blob, so a reader who checks the wrong route will read a live
citation as a dead one.

**`HELM-FEEDBACK.md` — the rotation landed 18 minutes before this note did.** The row was already stale
when it was written; the claim that every sha was current was wrong on the day, not merely overtaken.
The rotation is a **pure append**: the old blob is a byte-exact prefix of the new one, so nothing was
rewritten and every figure in the old row is still true of the region it measured. The appended 58,689 B
carry **+1 short form and +42 long form**, giving that file **172 / 298** on `main`.

**Corrected totals on `main`: 1,037 short form, 6,482 long form** — the table's 1,036 / 6,440 plus the
rotation's 43 sites. This README's own row contributes 0 / 1 on **either** revision (re-measured after
the note and the gloss), so the two count columns are stable under this file's own edits and the
corrected totals do not move when this paragraph lands. The **byte** total is not restated, because the
index is edited and any byte total for it is stale the moment it is written.

**Expect this to keep happening, and do not read it as corruption arriving.** The 2026-Q3 archive is not
a frozen directory with a fixed checksum — channel rotation appends to it on a schedule, and every
rotation carries in text that was already corrupted at its live source upstream. So these counts drift
**upward by construction**. A checker that pins the totals above and reds when they move is measuring
rotation, not relay corruption. What must stay true is the invariant Q3(b) actually ruled: **each rotated
file's existing bytes are never edited in place** — appends from rotation are legal, repairs are not.
That invariant is checkable (old blob must remain a prefix of the new), and it held for DRA-329.

**This file's own row is not a curiosity.** The `1` counted against this README is in the DRA-55 LOCK
quoted three paragraphs above — the LOCK that forbids repairing this archive without a separate Helm
ruling. It arrived through the same relay as everything else it governs, so **read verbatim it says the
opposite**: it reads as permitting archive repair. The sentences around it carry the true sense
("**stays live**… still needs a real, separate Helm ruling"), and Q3(b) has now ruled the same way
independently, so nothing has ever acted on the inverted reading. **It is left exactly as it is.** A
quoted Helm LOCK is Part A text; decoding one is Helm's word, not a carry-out — it is recorded here and
carried to Helm as a follow-up, not rewritten by the seat that found it.

**Where the repaired copy is.** The live `HELM.md` at the repo root is repaired and current: DRA-309
and DRA-325 restored 51 negations across eleven entries (PR #809, merged `f14696b2`), and DRA-327 Q2(a)
decoded the last short-form site there — *"No 7 KB walls on a HELM tip."* — in PR #815 (`86ae627e`).

**Do not expect the live file to count zero.** It carries **4 short-form and 9 long-form** occurrences
on `main` at `86ae627e`, and every one of them is a **deliberate mention** — doctrine text *about* the
substitution rather than a ruling corrupted by it. They are the DRA-309 and DRA-325 relay notes stating
their own counts, the AMENDed doctrine line's discriminator, the reading rule that tells a seat how to
reconstruct the negation, and Helm's DRA-327 tip itself, which necessarily quotes the corrupted string
in the course of ruling on it. **Corrupted sites: zero. Total sites: thirteen.** The two numbers are
different things, and a checker built to assert zero reds on the remedy rather than on a defect — which
is why the repair was measured as "no site remains that a reader could mistake for a ruling", never as
an absolute count.

Quote rulings from it, never from
`docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/HELM.md`, which is the corrupted **original of record** and
is kept that way on purpose: it is what the relay actually delivered, and a repaired archive could no
longer prove that.

This is the same logic as the mojibake ruling two sections up, reached separately and for the same
reason — a rotated copy is not an independent site of corruption, and repair pays on the live files.
The difference is only that this defect inverts meaning rather than mangling glyphs, so the count is
worth stating precisely instead of leaving to a reader's guess.

### A transcript is not a map, and the doc sweep had to learn the difference

`DocumentationTests.EveryFileTheDocsPointAtExists` sweeps every `.md` under
`docs/ops` and fails any backticked path that no longer resolves. It reddened on
all three archived ledgers the moment they landed — they name a retired
release-review script, a scratch path under /tmp, and a gitignored seat-claims
file, all of which were true on the day an agent typed them. (Those names are
deliberately **not** backticked in this paragraph: this README *is* swept, so
quoting a dead path here would redden the very test being described.)

**Both of that test's remedies — "fix the doc" and "restore the file" — are
unavailable here.** The file is immutable by construction, and the paths are
history rather than error. So the ledgers are exempt and **this README is not**:
it is the one file in this directory a reader navigates by, so a dead pointer in
it is the ordinary defect that test exists to catch. The exemption is paired with
`DocumentationTests.OnlyTheRotatedChannelTranscriptsAreExemptFromTheLivePathSweep`,
which fails if the exemption ever stops matching anything (trap 78), if the
README slips out of the sweep, or if any other `docs/ops` doc slips out with the
transcripts (trap 34). Prove-failed by disabling the predicate: 4 red, 21 green.

**A future rotation inherits this for free** — the exemption is keyed on the
`channels/` directory, not on these three filenames.

## What was NOT rotated, and why

**Amended 2026-09-18 (pass 3): `HELM.md` has now rotated, and not on the >30-day arm.**
The paragraph below is left as written because it was true and correctly reasoned on
2026-09-14; what it could not see is that the **size** arm is the one that fires first on
this file. `HELM.md` reached 1,047,518 B — 16x the 64 KiB policy — while still holding
nothing over 30 days old, because it takes ~13 KB per append. A calendar rule alone would
never have moved it. `FABLE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` stay unrotated: `DECISIONS.md` is at
675,660 B against a 676,484 B grandfather cap, which is 824 bytes of band and its own next
pass, and appending a pointer into 824 bytes is not a margin.

`HELM.md`, `FABLE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` are named in DRA-75 for a **>30-day**
rotation. On 2026-09-14 they hold **nothing older than 30 days** — the oldest
dated entry anywhere in the channel set is **2026-08-21**, 24 days old. The rule
is real and stays; it simply moved zero bytes this pass. The evidence:

```bash
python scripts/channel-rotate.py report HELM.md FABLE.md DECISIONS.md --cutoff 2026-08-15
```

`BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md` (515 KB) was outside DRA-75's scope and is the obvious next
candidate — a 2026-09-08 cutoff would move 92 entries / 464 KB. That call is
Bevel's; it is asked in `BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md` and has not been run.

## HELM-FEEDBACK.md is recovered text, not the bytes that were on disk

This is the part worth reading before trusting the file.

Commit `c7a597a8` appended to `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` in a way that **flattened the
entire 12,254-line file onto a single line** and re-encoded it through cp437
(trap 60c). A later append did the same thing again. The result was a 5.0 MB
file whose two largest lines were ~2.4 MB each and held **two mojibake copies of
one history**.

The readable history survived in git at `f4af3b5f` (1,909,798 bytes, 12,254
lines) and is what this archive carries, verbatim.

`scripts/probe-uncovered.py` is the proof that dropping the corrupt bytes loses
nothing. It peels the cp437 layers and shows:

- the second flattened line, peeled, **is** the `f4af3b5f` blob, whole — a pure
  duplicate;
- the first, peeled, is `[the PR #564 entry] + [f4af3b5f minus its first entry]`.

So the only content unique to 4.93 MB of flattened bytes was the 4,519-byte
**PR #564** entry. It is recovered, de-mojibaked, and sits at the top of the
archive. Its words are intact; **its line breaks are not recoverable and are
gone**, so it reads as one long line. The corrupt bytes are kept verbatim in
`HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md` beside this file — so the claim above is
checkable against them, not just against git `1e0f7232`.

**The corruption is not finished.** Entries written since still carry fresh
mojibake (`╬ô├ç├╢` and `ΓÇö` both appear in 2026-09-12/13 entries). This
rotation cleaned up the accumulated damage; it did not fix whatever keeps
producing it. That is a live problem, not an archived one.

## Two things that cost time here

1. **An additions-only diff passes on a silently flattened append.** That is how
   trap 60c ran twice without anyone noticing — the bytes genuinely were only
   added. The tell was never the diff; it was the **line count** going
   12,254 → 2. Nothing watches that.
2. **Never locate the flattened lines by index.** They were at 0-based 70/72
   against one ref and 788/790 against the next one an hour later, because
   channel entries prepend. Both scripts find them by size (`>= 100 KB`).

## Why this lives under `claude-archive/`

DRA-75's issue named `docs/ops/archive/2026-Q3/`. It is here instead, and the
reason is worth recording: `scripts/channel-wipe-guard.ps1` — the guard built
after a channel ledger was destroyed three times in six days — reads its ARCHIVE
exemption out of `docs/ops/claude-archive`, and it deliberately has **no
`-Force` and no skip switch**. Putting the archive anywhere else meant either
failing the guard or editing it as part of the very change it exists to refuse
(trap 52). The path was the cheap thing to move; the guard was not.

## Verifying a rotation

`core.autocrlf=true` in this repo, so `git show ref:path` returns the
LF-normalized blob while the working tree holds CRLF. **Verifying a rotation
against a git blob is a false failure** — it produced one during DRA-75, on a
rotation that was in fact byte-perfect. Take a byte copy of each file before
rotating and verify against that:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/pristine && cp HELM-FEEDBACK.md FABLE-FEEDBACK.md /tmp/pristine/
python scripts/channel-rotate.py rotate --apply
python scripts/channel-rotate.py verify --pristine /tmp/pristine
```

`verify` asserts that every original entry block survives byte-exact across
archive + active (a superset is allowed, so later appends do not redden it),
that the archive contains the `f4af3b5f` blob verbatim, and that the recovered
#564 entry is clean UTF-8 rather than mojibake.
