# Soft / local ops — how to use C′ and the CLAUDE split

Two 2026-09-08 operating-model experiments, kept reversible (docs + light tooling).
CI/`main` gates are unchanged and remain authoritative.

## What Soft reads first

1. **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** — live manual. Current rules, architecture
   invariants, operating contracts, compact traps. Always loaded.
2. **[verification-ladder.md](verification-ladder.md)** — how much to verify
   locally before you push. Sized by V0–V3 consequence, not by habit.
3. **[flake-ledger.md](flake-ledger.md)** — known intermittent failures.
   “Passed on rerun” is an **observation**, not a resolution.
4. **[execution-flow.md](execution-flow.md)** — how a slice gets from a signed
   plan onto `main` (DRA-73 M0, 2026-09-14; live flow DRA-571, 2026-09-30).
   **No `helm/ssc-N` PRs:** a ruling is a PR review, a card comment, or a
   `HANDOFF.md` commit. **A signed plan authorizes its whole slice sequence**
   in order on green gates — signing is Planner routing it. **Dranak stops
   the train with a HOLD** in `HANDOFF.md`, not by withholding per-slice
   authorization. Reviewer sign-off is the merge review. There is no Helm
   tip, SIGN, last-look or wake.
5. **[exo-dashboard.md](exo-dashboard.md)** — what the execution model actually
   costs (DRA-73 §6). The DRA-70/71/72 window is a **frozen baseline**
   (`exo-baseline.json`), so a later claim that the new model is faster is
   checkable rather than felt. Regenerate with
   `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/exo-metrics.ps1 -FromPr <n> -ToPr <m>`.
   A metric with no data in the window reads `unmeasured`, never `0`.
6. **[merge-sync.md](merge-sync.md)** — when a PR merges, the Paperclip issue
   its **branch** names moves to `done` (DRA-77 M0-4). One way, GitHub →
   Paperclip. **The branch beats the PR body**, because every body here carries
   a `Governing plan: DRA-73` line. `blocked` and `cancelled` are refused, not
   closed. **Inert until three Actions secrets exist** — it prints
   `SKIPPED: not configured` and names them.
7. **[pc-change-runbook.md](pc-change-runbook.md)** — how a seat on a card makes
   a change on David's PC without Bosun: install, restart, script runs, merges
   (DRA-601). The drill evidence is on the card. All four classes were drilled
   once on 2026-09-30; the deliberate restart was drilled on DRA-619.

Do **not** load the archive at session start. Open a novel only when a compact
live rule is not enough to act. `DocumentationTests` scans this directory so
the pointers stay true.

## Compact Soft rules

- **Verify to the class, then stop.** V0 is targeted unit/static. V1 adds the
  relevant unit suite and targeted E2E when the change is user-visible. V2 runs
  the affected suites plus integration (`scripts/check.ps1`). V3 is full
  discipline. Local green never waives CI.
- **A flake you have not named is still open.** Add a ledger row. Do not “fix
  product” because CI was red once and green on rerun. Do not treat a rerun
  green as closed.
- **CLAUDE.md stays the pointer set.** Incident novels, superseded mechanisms,
  and historical evidence live under
  [claude-archive/](claude-archive/README.md). Progression:
  incident → verified lesson → executable test/guard → compact live rule.
  Once a guard exists, drop the novel from always-loaded — not the rule.
- **Practice that stays:** evidence before confidence; prove-fail
  a new guard; Reviewer sign-off is the merge review; ship the instrument before
  the third theory; local greens are not CI.

Out of this experiment: no model-routing pilot, no HELM-FEEDBACK migration,
no Play Console / signing / prod secrets.
