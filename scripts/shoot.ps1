# Screenshot fixture: a real EQBuddy.exe, a seeded session, an OPAQUE render.
#
# Two things made a capture unusable before this existed (2026-08-17):
#
#   1. An isolated EQBUDDY_APPDATA profile has no session, so every card renders
#      "0 dps / 0 kills / 0 items". Fixed by seeding the profile's log folder with the
#      time-shifted fixture (scripts/make-test-session.ps1) — the same recipe
#      tests/EQBuddy.E2E/FixtureLog.cs uses — so the app replays a rich session at
#      startup and the shot shows real numbers that are not a real person's.
#   2. Every window is translucent by design (it sits over a running game), so whatever
#      was behind it bled into the PNG. Fixed on two fronts: EQBUDDY_OPAQUE=1 makes the
#      window GROUND opaque (UI.Shared/CaptureTheme.cs), and a plain full-screen backdrop
#      sits behind everything so the rounded corners land on one flat colour instead of
#      the desktop.
#
# Nothing here touches the real profile: EQBUDDY_APPDATA points at a temp tree that is
# deleted afterwards unless -KeepProfile.

    # reviewed anyway.
    #
    # It exists to MEASURE, not only to illustrate. Bevel's item 1 flagged one thing it
    # could not answer from source — whether "est" and the duration source still fit inside
    # a chip at this density or have to move to the tooltip — and said to measure it against
    # a real screenshot rather than assume. This is that screenshot.
    #
    # Eight buffs, cast by SANCTARI rather than by You, so Spell Casting Reinforcement
    # cannot lengthen the estimates and make the numbers depend on the fixture's AAs. Names
    # deliberately span the range that decides the wrap: "Valor" (5) to "Riftwind's
    # Protection" (21), which is past the 104-unit trim.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written BEFORE the shot (trap 23):
    #   * Header "8". No set line and no suggestion rows — the fixture profile has no buff
    #     set, and the set line only appears when a SET buff is not cleanly up.
    #   * A WRAPPING GRID of eight chips, NOT eight full-width rows. No icon on any chip:
    #     every chip in this card is one family, so the emblem carried no information.
    #   * Chips in fade order (the tracker's own): Insight 40:00, Brilliance 40:00, Spirit
    #     of Ox 45:00, Symbol of Pinzarn 45:00, Valor 54:00, Health 54:00, Riftwind's
    #     Protection 60:00, Aegolism 150:00 — every one of them with " est" on the face and
    #     a gauge painted nearly full (they have just landed and these chips DRAIN).
    #   * "Riftwind's Protection" trims with an ellipsis; its full name is in the hover,
    #     which a capture cannot show.
    #   * Accent ink on every countdown and no warn borders: nothing is inside the 60 s
    #     warning window, which is what makes this the ROSTER rather than the HUD row.
    # Eight chips that came back as eight full-width rows is the trap-25 failure this
    # picture exists to catch, and no diff, test or build can see it.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-07, 338x546. Every element of the prediction held — eight chips in a
    # wrapping grid, no icons, in the predicted fade order, "Riftwind's Protecti…" trimmed,
    # no set line, no suggestions, accent ink throughout — with the clocks nine seconds
    # further on than predicted (39:51 rather than 40:00), which is the settle and not a
    # defect.
    #
    # WHAT IT MEASURED, which is why it was taken twice. With " est" on every face the eight
    # chips wrap to FIVE rows; without it, to FOUR. The suffix is ~22 of the card's ~306
    # usable units, and at five rows the wrap is roughly a WASH against the eight full-width
    # rows it replaced — so on this surface the marker was not a four-character cost, it was
    # most of the density the change exists to deliver. Bevel's item 1 flagged exactly this
    # as unanswerable from source, and the answer went the way the picture pointed:
    # BuffRosterPresentation.RosterFace drops it, the hover keeps the whole sentence, and the
    # HUD chicklet — one or two at a time, in a window that measures to its own contents —
    # still carries it on the face. THIS PICTURE IS THE FOUR-ROW ONE.

    #
    # The illustration lock (Helm-signed 2026-09-04) says an illustration of our own UI is
    # a capture WITH A RECIPE or it does not ship, so these land in the same change as the
    # window. The shell's player door is the widget's "Guide…" context-menu row (OE-2;
    # "Open EQBuddy…" until 2026-09-08), and a capture cannot click one — EQBUDDY_SHELL is
    # how a shot lands on a NAMED
    # room, which is trap 22's condition and the reason the hook stays beside the row.
    #
    # Title is 'EQBuddy — Progress'. NOT the theme windows' 'EQBuddy Progress': this is
    # a normal Windows window with native chrome, which is the whole product point of the
    # host, and its title bar names the room the way a shell application's does.
    #
    # **That suffix is load-bearing for the harness, not decoration.** MainWindow.xaml's
    # title is exactly 'EQBuddy', so a bare 'EQBuddy' here would match the widget too —
    # trap 24 arriving INSIDE one process, where -OwnerPid cannot separate them because
    # both windows have the same owner. HistoryWindow already had this shape.
    #
    # Trap 53 applies from here on: this Title is an identity the WINDOW can invalidate
    # without touching this file, and one stale title stops the whole batch at its row.
    # It is derived from ShellPages.Label(page), so it moves only if a room is renamed —
    # at which point these three rows should indeed fail rather than photograph something
    # else.

    #     Faction), not four: Raids moved to the Live room. The v1 Progress WINDOW still
    #     shows four, so 'progress-window' and this shot legitimately differ, and a fourth
    #     chip appearing here again would mean the room stopped reading `MovedToLive`.
    #   'shell-progress'  — a native title bar reading "EQBuddy — Progress" with real
    #     minimise / maximise / close and a taskbar entry, NOT the hand-drawn chrome
    #     every theme window has. Under it a title row: app icon, "EQBuddy", and a search
    #     field on the right with a magnifier and the hint "Search  Ctrl+K". Down the left,
    #     a rail on a panel ground. **This prediction was written at PR 1 and said ONE row
    #     — a chart icon and "Progress" — and it is FIVE now** (Home · Progress · Gear ·
    #     Quests · World), because a room's row lands in the PR that lands the room. What
    #     has not changed and is still the assertion: Progress is lit as selected, and there
    #     is no Settings row, because that room does not exist and a disabled row is an
    #     affordance that opens nothing. (There IS a Live row now — E-3 PR 5 — and this
    #     prediction has been amended rather than left, since a stale prediction is worse
    #     than none: it makes a correct picture look like a regression.) To its right, the
    #     Progress room: a THREE-chip wrapped strip (Experience · Wealth · Faction) with the
    #     same badges the Progress WINDOW's strip carries, Experience lit, and the Experience
    #     body under it. The window's own fourth chip, Raids, is on `shell-live-raids` now.
    #   'shell-narrow' — the SAME window at the floor width. The rail must be icons only
    #     (chart glyph, no "Progress" word) with the room name still on hover, and the
    #     room content must not clip. That is degrade axis 1, and it is the half of the

    #
    # **'shell-progress-raids' IS GONE, and its disappearance is the point** (E-3 PR 5). The

    # days across four releases. The replacement is 'shell-live-raids' below; the committed

    #     the loot list itself in the body. Again one deliberate absence: the
    #     "Show in mini dashboard: ★ Loot" row stays with GearLootWindow, for the same

    #
    #   'shell-gear-narrow' — THE ONE THAT CAN DISPROVE SOMETHING, and it is here for that
    #     rather than for illustration. ShellLayoutPolicy.MinRoomWidth is 520 —
    #     ProgressWindow's shipped width — and PR 2 added a room whose own window opens at
    #     880. This is that room, on its widest tab, at the floor (520 + the 60-unit
    #     collapsed rail). Predicted: the rail is icons only, three glyphs and no words,
    #     room names on hover; the five seeded wishlist rows read without horizontal
    #     clipping; and the ⧉ copy of /outputfile inventory is still visible without
    #     scrolling, which is the affordance trap 34 keeps a must-list row for on this
    #     surface. **If a row clips, the constant moves — not this shot, and not a
    #     horizontal scrollbar, which would hide a layout failure behind an affordance.**

    # ---- E-3 PR 3: the Quests room, and the split threshold ---------------------------
    #
    # Same illustration lock: a room's shot lands in the PR that lands the room. Title is
    # 'EQBuddy — Guide' since 2026-09-08 — the room was relabelled by the owner's amendment
    # to Bevel's cog/Options IA faces (the WIRE key is still `quests`, which is why the
    # EQBUDDY_SHELL addresses below did not move). Derived from ShellPages.Label, so trap 53
    # applies and these rows should indeed fail rather than photograph something else if the
    # room is renamed again. The SHOT NAMES stay `shell-quests*`: a shot name is a filename
    # the docs already point at (trap 21), and renaming one is its own change.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-quests' — native chrome and the title row as every shell shot has, with the
    #     rail now FOUR rows in RailOrder: Progress (chart), Gear (bag), QUESTS (quest
    #     icon), World (pin). **Quests must sit BETWEEN Gear and World** — the rail walks
    #     RailOrder filtering by Landed, so this is correct by construction and would look
    #     identical to a healthy build if it silently were not, which is the whole reason
    #     this line is written down. Quests lit, the other three dim.
    #     The room: the character caption ("Quest Tracker — <name>", dim, one line), then
    #     a four-chip wrapped strip Quests · Epic 1.0 · Plane of Sky · Unlocks with their
    #     real badges, the search box spanning the header with its placeholder, the
    #     era/state/class filter row, the mode strip on the right, and under it the LIST at
    #     400 wide beside the DETAIL pane — the fixture's ledger picks a first row and the
    #     pane shows its rewards and turn-ins.
    #     **And one thing that must NOT be there**: the view's own title row with the app
    #     icon and the close button. QuestsRoom calls HideOwnTitleBar(), and a second title
    #     bar under the shell's native one is exactly what a picture is for.
    #
    #   'shell-quests-sky' — the same frame addressed to a room inside the room. Plane of
    #     Sky lit; the two ⧉ command buttons (/outputfile achievements and /outputfile
    #     inventory) side by side above the rows; the #243 leftover boxes if the fixture's
    #     dump produces any; and NO detail pane — a checklist has nothing to select, so its
    #     width goes back to the rows. This is the shot that says the five presentation
    #     rules came across the lift.
    #
    #   THE SPLIT THRESHOLD, both sides, which is what the signed ruling asked for. The
    #   room's share is the window minus the 200-wide rail, so at 900 the room is EXACTLY
    #   SplitRoomWidth and at 899 it is one unit short. The rail is expanded at both
    #   (RailLabelWidth is 520 + 200 = 720), so the pair isolates axis 2 from axis 1 —
    #   which is the whole reason the two thresholds are separate numbers.
    #
    #   **THE FIRST RUN OF THIS PAIR DISPROVED THE CONSTANT, which is what it was for.**
    #   The ruling said to shoot SplitRoomWidth = 640 both sides, so the pair was 840/839
    #   and the prediction was "two panes, then one". The 840 picture came back with two
    #   panes and a detail column of about 190 units: the quest title broke MID-WORD
    #   ("Bone / Chips / (Kaladi / m)") and the 220-capped reward tiles clipped. 640 was
    #   HistoryWindow's measured pair (a 330-wide list), and this room's list is 400 —
    #   Gate 2's shipped number, which a lift may not re-decide. So the CONSTANT moved to
    #   700 and this pair with it, per MinRoomWidth's own rule: the number is a claim, the
    #   screenshot is what tests it, and a room that clips at the threshold moves the
    #   number rather than the shot. The 840 picture is not committed — an illustration of
    #   a state the code no longer produces is exactly the drift the lock exists to stop.
    #
    #   PREDICTION for the second run, written before it:
    #   'shell-quests-split' (900) — two panes: the 400-wide list and a ~300 detail pane
    #     beside it. The title reads on one or two lines with NO mid-word break, and a
    #     reward tile shows its whole name or ellipsizes cleanly. No back button.
    #   'shell-quests-narrow' (899) — ONE unit narrower and a different layout: the list
    #     takes the full width, the detail pane is gone, and no back button is on screen
    #     yet (there is nothing to come back from until a row is clicked). The rail must
    #     still show its labels in BOTH — if it collapses in one of them, the two axes are
    #     not independent and it is the arithmetic that moves, not this shot.

    # reward is authored, so this frame is the guide engine's own acceptance criterion:
    # the item rows are GONE and the walkthrough is in their place.
    #
    # IT HAD STOPPED BEING THAT, AND THE RECIPE DID NOT NOTICE. Folding landed in #491 and
    # this shot expands nothing, so from that day it photographed six folded headings and
    # NO rows - a duplicate of shell-quests-sky-guide-folded, under a comment claiming to
    # be the walkthrough's acceptance criterion. Trap 22's other half: staging that stops
    # matching what the recipe SAYS it shows fails silently, because the picture is still

    #
    # PREDICTED before shooting (trap 23), from the shipped catalog and the ticks below:
    #   * six heading LINES, each a "+" then the name and its counts - except "Runed Wind
    #     Amulet", which shows "-" and its steps;
    #   * NO caption line on any of the six. Every Warrior reward has been fully authored
    #     since DRA-44 and none is skipped here, and the caption now draws only where it
    #     adds stubs or skipped. (This prediction used to promise "Guide - n of m - k
    #     stub(s)" under all six, and both halves of that stopped being true.)
    #   * under the open one: its NEXT card, then "Isle 4: Keeper of Souls" with the Stone
    #     Amulet row TICKED, "The wind rune"
    #     then the Wind Rune Azia row - authored, NOT stubbed, carrying the zone page's
    #     "any Plane of Sky mob" line - then "Turn in to Torgon Blademaster" and its row
    #     reading "after: ..." naming the step that still gates it. TALLER THAN THE DEFAULT
    #     so that last row is IN the frame: the first take of this restaging clipped it one
    #     line below the fold, which is the same below-the-fold miss the card shot had.

    #   * a pencil at the end of EVERY row, not only hollow ones;
    #   * "Belt of the Four Winds" reads "3/4 - ready" and offers "Mark turned in" on its
    #     heading - every piece held, and the turn-in row does NOT count itself among the

    # ---- Delivery 3 (DRA-41): EPIC 1.0 ON THE GUIDED MODEL ---------------------------
    #
    # Two frames on purpose, and the pair is the point: the SHORTEST epic chain beside the
    # LONGEST one. Fable §4 asks Bevel to rule between two answers for long chains (fold at
    # the stage level, or "step 12 of 66 · section 3 of 5" on the card) and neither can be
    # judged from the short frame alone.
    #
    # PREDICTED before shooting (trap 23), from the shipped catalog and the ticks below:
    #
    # 'shell-quests-epic-guide' — PALADIN, 14 rows in 2 sections, expanded.
    #   * The per-class band at the top: "Paladin" and a "Mark as complete" button (the
    #     verb, since the 2026-09-11 Founder smoke — a green "Epic complete" over 0/14 read
    #     as a done-badge). Epic completion is per CLASS, so that band stays where it was —
    #     the guide did not move it and did not grow a second control for it.
    #   * ONE heading line where the classic tab drew TWO (one per section): a "−" fold
    #     control, then "Paladin · Epic 1.0   0/14". NO "· done/ready/in progress" note —
    #     nothing is ticked. The heading opens the Paladin Epic Quest wiki page, not a page
    #     called "Epic 1.0"; its hover lists the reward the page lists ("Rewards Fiery
    #     Defender.") and shows NO item stats block, because an epic pays several items and
    #     eqlwiki names none of them "the epic".
    #   * NO caption line: 0 skipped and 0 stubs. Transcribed is NOT a stub — 486 rows that
    #     ARE directions must not tell the player we cannot give them directions.
    #   * The NEXT card under it: "NEXT:" then the page's own first sentence verbatim
    #     ("Complete quest for The Fiery Avenger, which includes …"), then "Works toward your
    #     Paladin epic." — and NOTHING ELSE. No direction sentence and no detail line, which
    #     is the whole visible difference between Transcribed and Authored: the page states a
    #     sentence, not who and where, so the card draws no line claiming otherwise. Then
    #     Done / Skip / the pencil.
    #   * Below it the stage heading "Checklist" and 13 rows, then "Resources" and 1 — the
    #     page's own sections, in the page's order, as the stage headings.
    #   * A pencil at the end of EVERY row. The sentence is the page's, so the page is where
    #     a wrong one gets fixed, and every row is a place that can be wrong.
    #   * NO dim second line under any row: who and where are empty by rule on a transcribed
    #     step, and a row line that is sometimes there and usually not reads as a bug.
    #
    # 'shell-quests-epic-guide-long' — DRUID, 66 rows in ONE section, expanded. The frame
    #   Bevel is being asked to rule on.
    #   * The same class band and ONE heading, "Druid · Epic 1.0   0/66".
    #   * ONE stage heading, and it reads "Druid Epic Quest" rather than "Checklist": the
    #     page has no sub-headings, so naming the run after the quest says something where
    #     "Checklist" over the whole quest says nothing.
    #   * Then sixty-six rows, which will NOT fit the frame — that is the finding, not a
    #     staging miss. The card scrolls away with them, so "what do I do next" leaves the
    #     screen the moment you start reading, and there is no way to fold a SECTION because
    #     there is only one. Both of Fable's candidate answers address exactly this.

    #   * The NEXT card names step 4 ("Give Tainted Darksteel Breastplate and Pure Crystal to
    #     Reklon Gnallen ...") — rows 0-3 are done.
    #   * The "Checklist" section heading has a SQUARE Track tick to its left, TICKED; the
    #     "Resources" heading has one too, unticked. Those two squares are the only square
    #     controls in the list.
    #   * Every step row leads with a ROUND mark instead of a box: rows 0-3 a green ring with

    #     ring and normal text; row 13 (Resources, skipped) an EMPTY ring with struck,

    # 'Aviak Talons' is PINNED so it is the pane's selection. Not left to the fixture's
    # bags: with no pin the list selects whatever happens to overlap, and a picture of the
    # wrong quest is a real state of something else (trap 23). Chosen off a survey of the
    # shipped harvest rather than by looking at frames (Fable recipe lesson 6) — it is the
    # smallest quest carrying BOTH kinds of row plus a prose stage, so the split is legible
    # in one screen. Expanded through the guide id, which is a quest group's fold key.
    #
    # PREDICTED before shooting (trap 23), from the survey of the shipped catalog:
    #
    #   * Native shell chrome, the four-row rail with Guide lit, the character caption, the
    #     four-chip tab strip with Quests lit, search box, filter row, mode strip on 'mine'.
    #   * The LIST at 400: 'Aviak Talons' FIRST and selected (raised background, accent
    #     border) — a pinned quest sorts first and stays visible with zero items held.
    #   * The DETAIL pane, top to bottom:
    #     - the title 'Aviak Talons' in accent, then four icons: a FILLED pin (accent), and
    #       Check / Close / Flag dim at 0.55.
    #     - the status line 'nothing held yet' — 0 of 2 pieces.
    #     - 'Rewards' and ONE tile reading 'Faction'. The wiki lists no item, so there is no
    #       item silhouette to speak of and no stats block anywhere on this frame.
    #     - **the guide block**: a '−' fold control then the word 'Guide', and under it the
    #       caption 'Guide · 2 stubs'. NOT 'Guide · 0 of 4' — the caption draws only where it
    #       adds stubs or skipped, and both Collect rows are stubs by DRA-45's rule.

    #       Reminjar 4 Aviak Talons, randomly looted from a krag elder, …'), then 'Works
    #       toward Aviak Talons.' and NOTHING BETWEEN THEM. No direction line and no detail
    #       line: the step is Transcribed, so the card draws no line claiming a who or a
    #       where the page never stated. Then Done / Skip / the pencil.
    #     - the stage heading 'Walkthrough' and ONE checkbox row carrying that same sentence,
    #       with a pencil and NO dim second line.
    #     - the stage heading 'Turn-in pieces', then the Bag provenance note ONCE (not once
    #       per item), then **TWO ITEM ROWS** — 'Aviak Chick Talon  0 / 1' and 'Aviak Talon
    #       0 / 1', dim, each with an item silhouette and a raised pill background. THESE
    #       ARE THE CLAIM: they are rows, not checkboxes, and there is no third and fourth
    #       checkbox repeating them. The stub sentence rides their hover, so it is not on
    #       screen in this frame.
    #     - then ONE checkbox row 'Hand the pieces to Bumle Reminjar.' with the dim
    #       'after: Collect Aviak Chick Talon, Collect Aviak Talon' naming what gates it,
    #       and a pencil.
    #     - 'Details' with Zone Kaladim, Giver Bumle Reminjar, Level 8+.
    #   * And one thing that must NOT be there: a 'Turn-ins' section label. The guide
    #     ABSORBED it — its stage heading is where those rows live now — and both on one
    #     frame would be the two-lists defect this slice exists to avoid.
    #   * Nor a 'Mark as turned in' button: nothing is held, so the hand-in is not offered.
    #
    # THE FIRST TAKE MISSED ITS OWN LAST LINE, and the prediction is what caught it. At
    # 1000x900 — the size the two epic frames use — everything above held, and the hand-in
    # row wrapped one line below the fold with 'Details' off-screen entirely. So the frame
    # showed the two piece rows and NOT the row they gate, which is half of what "the
    # turn-in pieces are the item rows" is about. Same below-the-fold miss the Sky card shot
    # had; the size moves, not the claim. The 900 picture is not committed.
    #
    # AND THE SECOND TAKE OVERSHOT THE MONITOR. 1120 is taller than this desk's 1032-high
    # work area, so the window ran off the bottom and the capture came back with 200 rows of
    # black under a complete frame — a picture that would look like a rendering bug to
    # anyone reading the docs. **A shot size is bounded by the smallest desk that has to
    # take it, not by the content**; 1000 leaves room for the taskbar on a 1080p screen,
    # which is the floor the rest of this file already assumes.

    # The lens is DRUID, not Warrior. It had to move: DRA-44 authored all 95 wind runes on
    # the zone page, so no Warrior reward has a stub left to photograph. The five that remain
    # are the isle-only ones, and the Druid's Efreeti Statuette is the one that sits in a
    # reward small enough to fit a card and its rows in one frame.

    # card (Where / What / Who) and the stub ROW in the same picture, which is what the
    # earlier two frames could not do. The stub-BANNER path is the untouched state of the
    # same group and is covered by GuidePresentation tests rather than by a second shot.
    #
    # PREDICTED before shooting (trap 23), from the catalog and the one tick below:
    #   * Druid lens; the six Druid rewards render as guides.
    #   * "Druid - Shillelagh" reads "- Druid - Shillelagh  1/4 - in progress" on one line,
    #     the "-" being the fold control OPEN, and "Guide - 1 stub" under it. The caption no longer repeats the count - the heading owns progress, the
    #     caption owns only what the heading has no room for - and Shillelagh is the ONLY
    #     Druid heading that carries one at all, DRA-44 having left the other five rewards
    #     with no stubs and nothing skipped.
    #   * Its card leads "NEXT:" + "Kill The Spiroc Lord on Isle 5 and loot the Spiroc
    #     Battle Staff.", then the direction sentence "Travel to Plane of Sky - Isle 5, then
    #     fight The Spiroc Lord.", then "Works toward the Shillelagh." - SENTENCES, not
    #     Where/What/Who labels (David, 2026-09-09) - then Done / Skip / the pencil.
    #   * No "Before leaving" line anywhere: no Sky objective waits on a later stage, so that
    #     warning cannot fire on this data (NoShippedSkyGuideCanTriggerTheBeforeLeavingWarningYet).
    #   * BELOW the card, the rows in stage order: Isle 5, the wind rune, THEN "Not placed",
    #     then the turn-in. "Loot the Efreeti Statuette." is TICKED and carries the wrapped
    #     "Wiki incomplete -" caption naming what the Druid page does not say - the page gives
    #     neither an isle nor a mob for that piece, so the row does not assert one (the first
    #     capture of this frame said "on Isle 4" one line above a note saying the page gives
    #     no isle). "Not placed" is now the LAST collection stage rather than the first: a
    #     stage whose whole content is "we could not place this" is the wrong thing for a
    #     class to open on (Fable's #491 defect 2), and this frame is where that was seen.
    # A class's quests FOLDED - the state a player now lands on (David, 2026-09-09: "see all
    # the quests for my class while they're collapsed and then dig into the details for each
    # by expanding the ones I want"). Druid, so the one expanded quest has a stub in it.
    #
    # NOTHING is expanded here, deliberately: this is the state a player LANDS on, and the
    # claim being photographed is "a whole class fits on one screen". The expanded state has
    # its own frame (shell-quests-sky-guide-card); a shot with one quest open spends most of
    # its height on that quest and proves the opposite of what this row is for.
    #
    # PREDICTED before shooting: six "Druid - <reward>" heading LINES, each one a small "+"
    # followed on the SAME line by the name and its counts, and NOTHING between them - all
    # six readable without scrolling, in six lines rather than twelve. The + leads the name
    # rather than sitting under it (David, 2026-09-09: "I imagined the + would be next to the
    # quest name, not wasting space between each quest name"), which is also where a
    # disclosure control belongs - the eye reads the + and then the thing it opens. The face
    # is +/- rather than words because six "Show steps" stacked down a folded list is more
    # text than the headings they sit under.
    #
    # EXACTLY ONE of the six carries a caption line, and it reads "Guide - 1 stub":
    # Shillelagh, which has the unplaced Efreeti Statuette stub in it. The other five draw no
    # caption at all. Both halves are Bevel's SIGNED one-liner and Fable's #491 defect 3 -
    # the heading owns pieces/ready, the caption draws only when it ADDS stubs or skipped -
    # and this frame is where it was seen: with the rows folded away, "Guide - 1 of 4" one
    # line under a heading reading "1/4 - in progress" was most of what was on screen.

    # ---- DRA-164: the ISLAND view ----------------------------------------------------
    #
    # THE FOUNDER'S OWN EXAMPLE, staged: warrior/monk/druid, grouped by island. The ask
    # (2026-09-17) was "multi-select which classes I am, then group checklist by island -
    # everything to collect on island N before moving to next", and the three classes are
    # named in it, so the picture is of the thing that was asked for rather than of a
    # convenient single class.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the run (trap 23). Nine groups, in this order, with these
    # counts - derived from the shipped GuideCatalog by scripts/dra164-island-survey.py and
    # narrowed to the three classes:
    #
    #     Island 3    0/3      Island 6    0/3      Islands 1.5 / 4 / 8   0/4
    #     Island 4    0/3      Island 7    0/4      Not placed            0/1
    #     Island 5    0/4      Island 8    0/3      The wind rune         0/18
    #
    # 43 gathering rows drawn out of 61 objectives; the other 18 are hand-ins and are
    # EXCLUDED, so the frame must carry the line saying so above the rows. NO "Island 1"
    # and NO "Island 1.5" group: the catalog locates no gathering work on either, and an
    # invented 1-8 scaffold is exactly what this view does not do.
    #
    # Every row says its own class and reward, because the reward heading is no longer above
    # it - that is the half of the design a count cannot check and a picture can.
    #
    # RE-PREDICTED FOR D4 (Founder CLARIFY 2026-09-17 ~8:11 AM CT, plan P8), because the
    # change is to the ROWS this frame exists to show and re-running the old recipe would
    # commit a picture nobody had predicted (trap 23). The class moved from the trailing
    # accent run to the FRONT of the title:
    #
    #   was:  Kill Gorgalosk on Isle 3 and loot...   Warrior - Belt of the Four Winds   <drop>
    #   now:  [Warrior] Kill Gorgalosk on Isle 3 and loot...   Belt of the Four Winds   <drop>
    #
    # So every row opens with a bracketed class, in accent-free body ink (the prefix is part
    # of the title run, not a second coloured run), and the accent run beside it is the
    # REWARD ALONE - no "Warrior - " in front of it any more. The class appears ONCE per row.
    # Three classes are staged, so a single island's block should show [Druid], [Monk] and
    # [Warrior] rows interleaved in that order (the sort is class, then reward, then title,
    # and it is unchanged). The headings, the counts, the exclusion line and the ORDER of the
    # islands are all untouched by D4 - if any of those moved, the re-shoot found a bug.
    #
    # TALLER THAN THE DEFAULT, for the reason the guide-card shot is: nine headings and 43
    # rows, and a frame that shows only the first island is not evidence about a view whose
    # whole claim is the ORDER the islands come in.
    #
    # MEASURED, and the prediction held: Island 3 0/3, Island 4 0/3, Island 5 0/4, Island 6
    # 0/3, ascending, with the hand-in line above them and no hidden-rewards line (nothing
    # is turned in). Every row says its class and reward.
    #
    # TWO THINGS THE PICTURE SAID THAT THE COUNTS COULD NOT, both recorded rather than
    # fixed here:
    #
    # 1. THE FRAME REACHES ISLAND 6 AND STOPS. The four groups below it - Island 7, Island
    #    8, "Islands 1.5 / 4 / 8", "Not placed" and "The wind rune" - are under the fold at
    #    900px, which is already about as tall as the shot host gets. So this frame is
    #    evidence that the islands ASCEND and that a player reads one island's work
    #    together; it is NOT evidence about where the multi-island set and the unlocated
    #    rows sit. Said out loud rather than cropped quietly, per the illustration lock.
    #
    # 2. THE ISLAND IS SAID THREE TIMES ON EVERY GUIDED ROW: the heading ("Island 3"), the
    #    step title ("Kill Gorgalosk on Isle 3 and loot..."), and the detail ("Gorgalosk -
    #    Plane of Sky - Isle 3."). That is the exact redundancy SkyIslands.WithoutIslePrefix
    #    removes for CLASSIC rows, and it does not reach a guided row's detail - which comes
    #    from GuidePresentation. It is NOT new in the island view and not this slice's to
    #    fix: the same three copies are on screen in class view under the stage heading
    #    "Isle 3: Gorgalosk", so touching it would change the view DRA-164 was told to KEEP.
    #    Filed for Bevel with this frame as the evidence.

    # **A state with a SKIPPED step in it, because that is the only state the lens visibly

    # three or four objectives each, and over those sizes the class view's own
    # progress-descending order and this lens's fewest-remaining order cannot disagree
    # (`k/4 > j/3` and `4-k > 3-j` have no solution). So a shot of the lens over a fresh
    # profile would photograph the class view and read as a passing feature — trap 22's
    # failure with the fixture present but wrong-shaped, and trap 23's with a real state of
    # something else in frame.
    #
    # The staged skip is the Azure Ruby Ring's Azure Ring loot step, which is a prerequisite
    # of that quest's hand-in — so the quest has one step left by the count, cannot be
    # finished at all, and is alphabetically FIRST (which is where the class view puts it).

    # **`EQBUDDY_SHELL = '1'` is deliberate and is half of what these shots prove.** Every
    # other shell row above names an explicit address; the bare hook asks for no room at
    # all, so the picture is evidence about the WINDOW's own default rather than about
    # whatever the harness typed. That is the same reason the E2E for it exists — until
    # PR 4 nothing walked this path, and the default was written in three places that were
    # never forced to agree.
    #
    # PREDICTION, re-written for DRA-63 before the re-shoot (trap 23). **Two of the three
    # rows below changed, and the changes are the whole of what this PR is:** the "Go to"
    # block is gone (Founder smoke 2026-09-11 — the rail down the left edge of the same
    # window already IS that list), and the ⧉ catch-up is now on EVERY readiness row rather
    # than only the ones that have never been run.
    #   'shell-home' — a native title bar reading "EQBuddy — Character" (DRA-66: the
    #     room the enum and the dump keys still call Home reads "Character" to a
    #     player — trap 53 is why these titles changed in the same diff as the label). The
    #     rail has SEVEN rows and Character is the TOP one, above Live, lit as
    #     selected — it did not have to be arranged there, `RailOrder` has had Home first
    #     since PR 1 and the room joining `Landed` put it in place. A rail that appended the
    #     room at the BOTTOM, or a shell that still opened on Progress, is a build that
    #     looks healthy in every way except this picture. Under it, THREE blocks with
    #     small-caps headings, in this order:
    #       Character  — "Testchar" in accent ink, "test · <zone>" under it, then the class
    #         line (DRA-66): "Warrior (inferred from your log)" — MEASURED, not assumed
    #         (trap 23: the first prediction said not-known-yet, and the fixture's own
    #         combat lines qualify Warrior). The "Set class…" door sits under it in accent
    #         ink. The not-known-yet sentence is the other healthy state, on a profile
    #         whose log has earned nothing — what this row must never show is no class
    #         line at all.
    #       Readiness — heading "Readiness — 4 not run yet"; four rows (Bags, Achievements,
    #         Factions, Spellbook), each with "Not run yet" in accent ink on the right, a dim
    #         line saying what it feeds, and a ⧉ copy button under it. FOUR buttons: the
    #         shoot profile has no dumps, so this shot cannot tell the change apart from the
    #         old build — 'shell-home-ready' below is the one that can.
    #       Recent session — "Session in progress" and one sentence. **No numbers**: the
    #         fixture IS a live session with 82 kills in it and the Home/Live boundary says
    #         Home does not draw them.
    #     **And NOTHING under it.** A fourth block headed "Go to", with a row per room, is
    #     the state this shot now disproves: the picture is the only place a resurrected
    #     block would show up, because nothing in the dump counts blocks by name.
    #     The block column is capped at `MinRoomWidth` and pinned LEFT — the first take of
    #     this shot is what asked for that, with "Not run yet" stranded about 600 units from
    #     the row it belonged to. If the answers drift back toward the right edge as the
    #     window widens, it is the cap that has come off.
    #   'shell-home-narrow' — the SAME room at the floor. The rail is icons only and the
    #     block column must look UNCHANGED, because its cap IS the floor's room width: this
    #     is the shot that can disprove that, the way 'shell-gear-narrow' can disprove
    #     MinRoomWidth itself. Anything clipping horizontally here means the cap is wrong,
    #     not the shot — and never a horizontal scrollbar, which hides a layout failure
    #     behind an affordance.
    #   'shell-home-ready' — the SAME room with an inventory dump staged, which is the only
    #     way to photograph the difference the Readiness block exists to draw AND the only
    #     way to photograph DRA-63's ask 1. Heading reads "Readiness — 3 not run yet"; the
    #     Bags row now carries a DATE in dim ink where the other three say "Not run yet",
    #     and — **this is the change** — it STILL carries its ⧉ copy button, with an "Open"
    #     link under it. Four ⧉ buttons in this picture, not three. On the old build the
    #     Bags row's button was gone and the "Open" stood alone; if this shot looks like
    #     that, the catch-up is still an empty-state affordance.
    #     The date-versus-"Not run yet" difference is the OTHER thing this pair proves: if
    #     the two pictures are indistinguishable, never-scanned and healthy have collapsed
    #     into one state, which is exactly what the pre-design forbade.
    #
    # There is NO shot of the room-level empty (no character at all), and that is a gap
    # named rather than hidden: this harness seeds a fixture log by construction, so
    # "EQBuddy has never seen a character" cannot be staged without a second profile shape
    # that nothing else here needs. `RoomEmptyState` and its words are unit-tested
    # (`HomeRoomTests`) and `shellHomeEmpty` is in the dump; the POSITION — centred in the
    # room's cell — is the part still unphotographed. Whoever adds that profile shape gets
    # the shot with it.
    #
    # ---- DRA-70: the HELPER room ------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # Same illustration lock: a room's shot lands in the PR that lands the room. Title is
    # 'EQBuddy — Helper', derived from ShellPages.Label, so trap 53 applies and this should
    # fail loudly rather than photograph something else if the room is ever renamed.
    #
    # **The rail is EIGHT rows now**, and every shell shot above says SEVEN in its own
    # prediction. Those lines are the state they were written in rather than a claim about
    # today — the count is asserted by `ShellNavigationTests.EightRoomsHaveLandedSoFar` and
    # by `shellRail` in E2E, which are the two places it can be wrong and say so.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-helper' — THE STATE A NEW PLAYER MEETS, and the one this profile can stage
    #     honestly: a character with a live log and no dumps at all. Native title bar
    #     "EQBuddy — Helper". The rail has EIGHT rows and Helper is SECOND, directly under
    #     Character and above Live, lit as selected. **That position is the assertion.**
    #     Unlike every room above it, Helper is NEW to `RailOrder` — nothing inherited its
    #     slot from PR 1 — so a build that appended it at the bottom of the rail is a build
    #     that looks healthy in every way except this picture.
    #     Three blocks with small-caps headings:
    #       Your goals — one dim sentence ("Pick what you are working toward…") over a
    #         WRAPPED strip of NINE chips in the Founder's order: Level Up · Farm Gear ·
    #         Unlock Classes · Unlock Races · Farm Motes · Work on Faction · Farm Materials ·
    #         Make Money · Achievements. **None of them lit** — nothing picked means EQBuddy
    #         weighs all of them, and a strip that arrived with everything selected would be
    #         saying the same thing in a way the player cannot turn off.
    #       Work on Faction — the sub-picker, drawn because nothing is picked (which weighs
    #         every goal). With no dump it is one dim sentence and a ⧉ copy of
    #         /outputfile faction.
    #       Worth doing next — the values line in dim metadata ink, then FOUR gap sentences
    #         (Level Up wants stored play; Work on Faction wants a pick; Unlock Classes and
    #         Unlock Races each want the achievements dump) and FIVE "not ranking this one
    #         yet" lines, each with its own accent-ink door to the room that answers it
    #         today. FOUR ⧉ buttons in the picture — the picker's, Work on Faction's, and
    #         one under EACH unlock goal. The repetition is deliberate (DRA-63's rule: a row
    #         that asks names its own answer); `helperCopyCmd` is the assertion, this is the
    #         review.
    #     **The prediction said "what must NOT be in this picture is a recommendation", and
    #     the shot disproved it — correctly.** The reasoning was that this profile has no
    #     stored sessions, so a %/hr here would mean the engine divided a LIVE session it was
    #     told not to touch. The premise was wrong: the fixture log's session ends a minute
    #     before the app starts, so it is ARCHIVED on ingest and is a stored 1.1-hour sitting
    #     in West Commonlands by the time the room draws. The picture is therefore honest and
    #     the prediction was not — which is the useful direction for this to fail in, and it
    #     is written down rather than quietly corrected because the next person predicting a
    #     shot of this profile needs to know the fixture arrives already archived.
    #     SHOT 2026-09-12, 946x633. What it actually shows: the nine chips as predicted, none
    #     lit; the picker's no-dump state with its ⧉; then ONE recommendation — "West
    #     Commonlands", "Level Up", "14.5%/hr here, from 1 stored session (1.1 hours)", "Your
    #     fights here run 6 sec on average, over 82 kills you have recorded", and a Map door.
    #     Under it THREE gap sentences (Work on Faction wants a pick, both unlocks want the
    #     achievements dump) and the five deferred lines. FOUR ⧉ buttons.
    #     **And the first take is what found two wordings**, which is the whole argument for
    #     the illustration lock: "across 1 of your session" (a lone plural toggle in the
    #     middle of an interpolation) and, on the picked shot, "you stand at 1,000, 1,000 from
    #     the top" (a comma that reads as a thousands separator). Both are fixed with a
    #     regression row; neither was visible in a passing assertion.
    #   'shell-helper-picked' — the SAME room with two chips ON and a faction dump staged,
    #     which is the only way to photograph the difference the picker exists to draw. Level
    #     Up and Work on Faction lit; the other seven dim. The picker now carries real chips
    #     reading "<faction> — N to go", with the picked one lit. Work on Faction's gap line
    #     is GONE and a recommendation stands in its place, headlined with the zone the
    #     appended kills happened in, with why-lines naming the standing and the player's own
    #     movers ("Your kills of Orc centurion in <zone> moved it +5 each — seen on 3 of your
    #     kills."), then a row of accent-ink doors (Map · eqlwiki · Standings). The five
    #     deferred goals are silent here, because a filter that still reported about what it
    #     filtered out would not be a filter.
    #     **The prediction expected Level Up to stay a gap here and the join to have no
    #     picture. Both were wrong, for the same reason as above** — the fixture's session is
    #     already archived — and the result is the shot this room most needed:
    #     SHOT 2026-09-12, 946x633. ONE row, headlined "West Commonlands", with
    #     "Level Up · Work on Faction" under it. **That second line IS HOME-005** — one place
    #     answering two goals, which is the cross-domain chain the PRD calls the key
    #     differentiator and which no single-goal list could draw. Under it, four why-lines
    #     from two different engines (the rate, the fight length, the standing, the mover:
    #     "Your kills of Orc centurion in West Commonlands moved it +5 each — seen on 3 of
    #     your kills."), a "1 more reason not shown" from the per-row cap, and THREE doors:
    #     Map · eqlwiki · Standings. The picker shows both dumped factions with the picked one
    #     lit. No ⧉ anywhere, because nothing is missing.
    #   'shell-helper-narrow' — the SAME room at the floor width. The rail is icons only and
    #     the nine chips must WRAP rather than clip: a horizontal strip that runs off the
    #     edge with no ellipsis is trap 25's canonical failure and this is the picture that
    #     can disprove it. Anything cut off horizontally here means the WrapPanel is wrong,
    #     not the shot — and never a horizontal scrollbar, which hides a layout failure
    #     behind an affordance.
    #
    # ---- DRA-71 D2: the nine chips became ONE DROPDOWN --------------------------------
    #
    # **The three predictions above are now the state they were written in, not a claim about
    # today.** The Founder smoked the D1 shots and called the chip strip flat checkbox soup, so
    # the nine goals moved inside an EqMultiPicker. Every "WRAPPED strip of NINE chips" line
    # above described what shipped in D1 and is left standing rather than rewritten — a
    # prediction edited after the fact is a prediction nobody made. What the three shots show
    # NOW, re-predicted before re-running them:
    #
    #   'shell-helper' / 'shell-helper-narrow' — where the nine pills were, ONE button reading
    #     "Any goal", left-aligned under the same dim sentence ("Pick what you are working
    #     toward…"), which now reads as a caption for a control rather than as an explanation
    #     of an off-state. The Work on Faction block below it likewise becomes a face, and with
    #     no dump it is still its dim sentence and its ⧉. Everything under "Worth doing next" is
    #     UNCHANGED — same recommendation, same why-lines, same doors, same FOUR ⧉ — because
    #     nothing about what the room decides moved in this slice. **The narrow shot's whole
    #     original job is retired by this change and that is worth saying out loud**: there is no
    #     strip left to wrap, so trap 25 cannot fire here any more. It is kept because "the room
    #     still reads at the floor width" is a different question that still has an answer.
    #   'shell-helper-picker' — the state the button hides, and the only picture in which D2 is
    #     visible at all. The face reads "Any goal"; under it an open popup on PopupBrush with a
    #     hairline border and card corners, holding NINE check rows in the Founder's order —
    #     Level Up · Farm Gear · Unlock Classes · Unlock Races · Farm Motes · Work on Faction ·
    #     Farm Materials · Make Money · Achievements — NONE ticked. The popup must sit BELOW the
    #     face and overlap the answers rather than push them down; anything that reflows the room
    #     when the picker opens means the popup was laid out inline, which is the one way this
    #     control can be wrong and still work.
    #   'shell-helper-picker-light' — the same popup in SOLARIZED, the only light palette, with
    #     Level Up and Work on Faction ticked and the face reading "Level Up · Work on Faction"
    #     (26 characters, inside the 34 the room budgets). **This is the shot most likely to
    #     disprove something.** The popup's chrome is four theme brushes and its rows are
    #     DesignSystem.Text at Role.Body; a control that reads fine on a dark ground and turns
    #     into grey-on-cream here is a real defect that every assertion in this repo passes
    #     (trap 31). Check the check-box glyphs too — they are WPF's own and are the one part of
    #     this popup the design system does not paint.
    #
    #   **WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, and it took three takes to get a reviewable picture.**
    #     SHOT 2026-09-13, 946x633. The room and the popup are as predicted — face "Any goal",
    #     nine rows in the Founder's order, none ticked, the popup OVERLAPPING the answers
    #     rather than reflowing them; and on the light shot the face reads "Level Up · Work on
    #     Faction" with two rows ticked. Getting there disproved two things:
    #       (a) **The first take of 'shell-helper-picker' was BYTE-IDENTICAL to
    #           'shell-helper'.** A WPF Popup is its own top-level HWND, so PrintWindow on the
    #           owner renders everything except the dropdown the shot is about. Nothing in the
    #           picture said so — it is a correct, well-composed photograph of a button — and
    #           only `md5sum` on the two files caught it. Fixed in `shot.ps1` (-WithPopups).
    #           **A screen grab was tried first and reverted twice**: take two had the
    #           always-on-top widget across the left half of the room, take three had an
    #           unrelated application on this machine's desktop in it. That is the failure
    #           PrintWindow exists to prevent, arriving by the door marked "just this once".
    #       (b) **The Solarized shot then showed a hard BLACK hairline round the popup** that
    #           appears nowhere else in that palette. It is not a product defect and it is not
    #           the theme: Solarized's `BorderBrush` is `#66586E75`, 40% alpha, and a popup's
    #           TRANSLUCENT pixels composite against the fresh (transparent-black) bitmap it
    #           is rendered into. A real state of the CAPTURE, photographed as if it were a
    #           state of the app — trap 23 one layer further out than usual.
    #           **CAVEAT, and it stays a caveat: this is NOT fixed.** Seeding the popup's
    #           bitmap with the pixels behind it was tried and changed nothing, because
    #           PrintWindow overwrites the DC rather than blending into it — so the
    #           translucent edge cannot be recovered. *In both picker shots, the popup's 1px
    #           outline is darker than the app draws it; everything INSIDE the popup is
    #           faithful.* Do not read the hairline as a palette decision, and if a future
    #           popup shot shows a border darker than its theme's value, suspect the capture
    #           before the theme.
    #
    # ---- DRA-71 D3: the level, and what it changes about an answer -------------------
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-home-level' — the Character room with the level editor OPEN, which is a state
    #     no shot of the shut room can reach (trap 22: a link and a link-over-a-box look the
    #     same). The Identity block, in order: "Testchar" in accent ink, "test · West
    #     Commonlands" under it, then the NEW row — "Level 28 — set by you" — then the accent
    #     link reading "Done" (the editor is open, so the door carries its open-state label),
    #     the dim note "Type the level this character actually is and press Enter…", a NARROW
    #     right-aligned box holding 28, and the accent row "Let EQBuddy work it out". Only
    #     THEN the class line ("Warrior (inferred from your log)") and "Set class…".
    #     **The order is the thing to check**: level before class, because the class editor is
    #     sixteen chips and would push this row off the fold every time it opened. And the
    #     zone line must still be there under the name — the plan's P4 says level is an ADDED
    #     identity row, and a shot where "Level 28" replaced "test · West Commonlands" would
    #     be this slice quietly reversing a documented DRA-63 decision while looking finished.
    #     Three blocks still, not four: the editor lives INSIDE Identity.
    #   'shell-helper-outgrown' — the Helper with ONE real archived session behind it (Prime)
    #     and a real ding appended, so every number is the fixture's own. Under "Worth doing
    #     next" and the source note, a NEW dim line: "Weighed at level 30, from your log's ding
    #     lines." Then the West Commonlands row carrying its measured rate, its cadence, and
    #     the P6 sentence — "The creatures you conned here ran L5–11, across N kills — you are
    #     level 30." The fixture's only /consider lines are Lvl 5 and Lvl 11, both in West
    #     Commonlands, so that band is a fact about this fixture and not a number I chose.
    #     **What must NOT be in the picture**: any sentence about the zone being easy, finished
    #     with, or worth leaving; any predicted rate for a zone the player has not farmed; and
    #     any "Level 0" anywhere. The goals face reads "Level Up".
    #
    #   WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SHOT 2026-09-13, 946x633. Both as predicted, and the
    #     Character one took two takes because the prediction was WRONG in a way nothing else
    #     could have caught:
    #       (a) **'shell-home-level' came back with an EMPTY box.** The prediction said "a
    #           narrow right-aligned box holding 28", and it held nothing — because the hook
    #           flipped `_editingLevel` on its own while a player clicking the same link went
    #           through a path that also seeds the draft. A correct, well-composed photograph
    #           of a real state of SOMETHING ELSE, which is trap 23 exactly, and invisible to
    #           every assertion in the repo: the box was there, the words were right, the
    #           level was right. Fixed with one `OpenLevelEditor` both paths call, and
    #           `shellHomeLevelDraft` now says from outside what is IN the box rather than
    #           that a box exists. Re-shot: the box holds 28. **The prediction is the whole
    #           reason this was found. A shot taken without one photographs whatever happens.**
    #       (b) 'shell-helper-outgrown' was right first time, and the numbers are the
    #           fixture's own: "14.2%/hr here, from 1 stored session (1.1 hours)", "your
    #           fights here run 6 sec on average, over 82 kills", and the P6 line reading
    #           "The creatures you conned here ran L5-11, across 26 kills - you are level 30."
    #           L5-11 is the fixture's only two /consider lines and 26 is the kill count of
    #           the creatures they belong to — a band nobody staged. ONE recommendation,
    #           because one prime run archives one session and West Commonlands is its primary
    #           zone; that is honest rather than thin. Nothing in the picture calls the zone
    #           easy, finished with, or worth leaving, and no rate is predicted for anywhere
    #           the player has not farmed.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: every 'shell-home*' and 'shell-helper*' shot changes in
    #     this slice — the Character room gains an identity row and the Helper gains the
    #     "Weighed at level …" line — so all seven were re-run rather than left stale. A
    #     committed shot that no longer matches the build is worse than no shot, because it is
    #     the one thing a reviewer trusts without checking.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURE IS 'quest-tracker', which needs no new shot and no new
    #     prediction: the class lens moved onto the same primitive in this slice, so that
    #     window's filter row must look EXACTLY as it did — era combo, state combo, the class
    #     face, then the mode strip, all on one row that does not wrap. The whole acceptance bar
    #     for the migration is "identical", and a shot that already exists is the cheapest way
    #     to check it. Re-run it.
    #     SHOT 2026-09-13: the row is intact and unchanged. **One prediction was wrong and is
    #     corrected here rather than quietly:** it said the face would read "Bard". It reads
    #     "Any class", because this row passes no `Ledger` and `Write-Ledger $null` DELETES
    #     quest-ledger.json — the Bard seeding belongs to the v1-import staging, not to the
    #     shared fixture. The "Warrior (inferred from your log)" line in the detail pane is
    #     class INFERENCE, which is a different producer from the picker (trap 4's two-sources
    #     shape, and the picture is where the two are easiest to confuse).
    #
    # ---- DRA-71 D4: the throughput lines (plan P7, Founder smoke item 3) --------------
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23). **What is pinned and what is not is
    # the first thing to read here.** The rates, the damage-per-second figures, the combat
    # hours and the fight lengths are the fixture's own arithmetic over a compressed hour;
    # the block above records, in this same file, what guessing a number the staging does not
    # pin costs the next reader. So the SHAPE is predicted, and the only literals predicted
    # are the ones the staging actually decides: the two zone names, the level, and the
    # absence of a difficulty badge.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-throughput' — the Helper with TWO real archived sessions in TWO zones
    #     and a real ding appended. The rail of seven with Helper lit, the goals face reading
    #     "Level Up", the source note, and the "Weighed at level 30, from your log's ding
    #     lines." line D3 added. Then TWO recommendation rows — West Commonlands (the
    #     fixture's own zone, from the first prime) and Kithicor Forest (this staging's, from
    #     the second) — each carrying, in this order:
    #       1. the measured experience rate with its session scope,
    #       2. **NEW — "You put out N damage a second here, over H hours of fighting. Across
    #          the 2 zones EQBuddy has measured, your damage and healing together run M a
    #          second; here, N."** The "2 zones" IS pinned: two primes, two primary zones, and
    #          the comparison clause exists at all only because there are two. A picture with
    #          one row, or with that clause missing, means the second prime collapsed into the
    #          first row (the adoption case `ShiftDays` exists to prevent) and the shot is of
    #          something else.
    #       3. the cadence line, **now with its own comparison** — "Everywhere EQBuddy has
    #          measured you, they run X." — or without it if the two round to the same words,
    #          which is a real arm and not a defect.
    #       4. the P6 outgrown line on West Commonlands only: its conned band is the
    #          fixture's own (Lvl 5 and Lvl 11), thirty-odd under 30. Kithicor's creatures
    #          conned Lvl 27, so it must NOT carry that sentence — and that is the row worth
    #          checking, because a discount sentence on a zone in band would be the P6 rule
    #          inverted and would look perfectly reasonable.
    #     **What must NOT be in the picture**, and each of these is a specific failure:
    #       - No "D0".."D4" badge anywhere. Neither zone is an instance, and a tier drawn for
    #         an open-world zone would be `InstanceTier` guessing the one thing its own line
    #         refuses to guess.
    #       - No sentence calling either place safe, easy, hard, tough, trivial, comfortable
    #         or efficient — in either direction. HOME-006 is a refusal, the vocabulary sweep
    #         is the guard, and this is the picture where a word that slipped past it would
    #         show.
    #       - No "and 0.0 healing a second". The fixture's character heals nothing, so the
    #         healing clause must be ABSENT rather than a zero.
    #       - No "Level 0" and no predicted rate for anywhere the player has not farmed.
    #       - No downtime line unless the fixture's own active/elapsed gap is over half, which
    #         it is not expected to be — the fixture is a dense hour. If one appears it is a
    #         finding about the fixture, not about the feature, and the honest response is to
    #         read the numbers rather than to change the threshold.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-throughput-light' — the same staging in SOLARIZED, the only light
    #     palette, because the new lines are the densest block of dim body text the room has
    #     and light is where dim-on-light contrast fails. Same content, same two rows; what is
    #     being checked is that six stacked personal sentences under one headline are still
    #     READABLE and still read as one row rather than as a paragraph. The translucency
    #     caveat of trap 79 does not apply — there is no popup in this shot.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURE: 'shell-helper-outgrown' changes in this slice, because it
    #     has an archived session and therefore now carries the throughput line. Its ONE row
    #     has one measured zone, so the comparison clause must be ABSENT — this is the picture
    #     of the single-zone arm, and a clause reading "across the 1 zones" or comparing the
    #     zone with itself would be the tautology `ThroughputBaseline.Known` exists to refuse.
    #     Re-run it.
    #     The other 'shell-helper*' shots have no `Prime` and so no archived session and no
    #     zone rows at all; nothing in D4 reaches them, and re-running them would produce
    #     byte-identical files.
    #
    #   WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SHOT 2026-09-13, 946x633, TWO takes — and the second take
    #     exists because the first found TWO wording defects that no assertion in this repo
    #     could have seen. Both sentences were correct, both numbers were real, and both were
    #     furniture. This is the whole case for writing a prediction down.
    #       (a) **"You healed 0.1 a second." on a WARRIOR.** The healing clause was gated on
    #           `Hps > 0`, which is the obvious reading of "only when there was some" — and
    #           the fixture's log has regen ticks in it, so "some" was 0.1 against 13.3 damage.
    #           The prediction said this clause must be ABSENT, which is the only reason it
    #           was looked for. Fixed with `HelperPresentation.HealingClauseShare` (a
    #           twentieth of the output); the WEIGHT still counts every point healed, because
    #           it was measured — only the clause is suppressed.
    #       (b) **"…together run 13.2 a second; here, 13.4."** A whole line spent saying a zone
    #           is exactly average, on the row where that is least interesting. Fixed with
    #           `BaselineClauseGap` (a tenth, either side), and the threshold RELATIONSHIP
    #           with `Recommendations.ThroughputShortfall` is now asserted rather than left to
    #           two numbers staying apart — a zone marked down with its explanation suppressed
    #           is the one failure this slice had to refuse.
    #     Everything else was as predicted: two rows (Kithicor Forest 14.4%/hr first, West
    #     Commonlands 13.2%/hr second, which is the P6 halving doing its job), the new
    #     throughput line on both, the cadence comparison ("…they run 6 sec.") on Kithicor,
    #     the P6 sentence on West Commonlands ONLY — its band is the fixture's own L5–11
    #     against level 30 — and none on Kithicor, whose creatures conned Lvl 27. No D-badge,
    #     no safety or difficulty vocabulary in either direction, no "Level 0", no downtime
    #     line (the fixture's hour is dense, as predicted).
    #
    #   AND THE ONE THING THESE SHOTS CANNOT SHOW, stated rather than staged. *After fix (b)
    #     neither row draws the baseline comparison, because both zones are within a tenth of
    #     the pooled figure — and no staging built on the shared fixture can do better. A
    #     session's dps is a SESSION figure attributed whole to its primary zone, so two
    #     slices of one log always carry nearly the same output however different their
    #     appended kills are. A genuinely different per-zone figure needs sittings actually
    #     played in different zones, which a compressed one-hour fixture does not contain.
    #     The comparison clause is unit-tested at both ends and prove-failed
    #     (`HelperPresentationTests`, `RecommendationsThroughputTests`); inventing a fixture
    #     whose damage was chosen to make the sentence appear would be staging a number to
    #     photograph a string, which is the failure trap 23 and trap 73 name from either
    #     side.*
    #
    # ---- DRA-71 D8: the professions block (plan P13; Founder smoke item 6) -----------
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-helper-materials' — the NARROWED state: one goal picked (Farm Materials) and two
    #     professions picked (Baking, Blacksmithing), with ONE real skill-up appended to the log
    #     so exactly one row carries a number and one does not. That pairing is the whole point
    #     of the picture: "no skill-up seen yet" and "skill 122" have to read as two different
    #     answers rather than as a number and a blank.
    #       - The goals face reads "Farm Materials" — one pick is always named, never counted.
    #       - One block headed "Farm Materials", its note, then the profession face reading
    #         "Baking · Blacksmithing" (19 chars against the room's 34-char budget, so it names
    #         rather than counts) and the picks in the CURATED list's own order — Baking before
    #         Blacksmithing, which is the enum's order and not the click order.
    #       - TWO rows, in that same order. The first says Baking has no skill-up in the log yet
    #         and names the game's own "You have become better at…" line. **It must not print a
    #         0.** The second reads "Blacksmithing — your log last raised it to 122, on <today>"
    #         — the date is the appended line's own stamp, so it is today's, and it is a fact
    #         about the fixture rather than a staged string.
    #       - TWO controls on each row: "Watch skill-ups" and "eqlwiki". Both say "Watch" rather
    #         than "Watching" — the fixture profile has no skill-up rule, and the label is read
    #         from the player's own rules every paint.
    #       - Then the park note, with its two numbers in it (10,957 pages read, 14 naming a
    #         profession). The block that says what EQBuddy cannot do is part of the picture.
    #       - Under "Worth doing next": NO recommendations — Farm Materials is still Deferred —
    #         and the deferral sentence naming which half is missing, with the Gear door under
    #         it. A picture where the block above is full of the player's own numbers and the
    #         sentence below says "not ranking this one yet" is exactly the reading this slice
    #         had to get right.
    #       - No sentence calling a profession easy, hard or trivial, in either direction. The
    #         HOME-006 sweep covers these sentences now and this is where a word that slipped
    #         past it would show.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-materials-light' — the same staging in SOLARIZED, the only light palette.
    #     Eight short caption rows with two accent links each is a new density for this room and
    #     light is where dim-on-light contrast fails. No popup, so trap 79's translucency caveat
    #     does not apply.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-professions' — the picker OPEN over the DEFAULT state: the goal picked and
    #     NO profession picked, which is the filter's empty state and therefore all eight rows.
    #     A dropdown that is shut photographs as a button (trap 22), and this is also the only
    #     picture that answers the product question the block invites — whether eight rows, each
    #     with a sentence and two links, reads as a list or as a wall. `EQBUDDY_HELPER_PICKER`
    #     is the room's own review hook, unset in every shipping run; `helperPickerOpen` in the
    #     E2E is the assertion that it is wired to the control rather than merely spelled right.
    #       - The face reads "Any profession" — nothing picked, and the control says so in its
    #         own words.
    #       - The popup holds EIGHT check rows in the curated order (Alchemy, Baking,
    #         Blacksmithing, Brewing, Fletching, Jewelcrafting, Pottery, Tailoring), none
    #         ticked, with Blacksmithing reading "Blacksmithing — 122" and the other seven
    #         "— not seen yet".
    #       - Eight rows under it, sixteen controls between them.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: 'shell-helper', 'shell-helper-narrow' and
    #     'shell-helper-picker' all change, because none of them picks a goal and "nothing
    #     picked" weighs every goal — so the new block is drawn in full, eight rows of "not seen
    #     yet". Re-run them. The other 'shell-helper*' shots pick goals that are not Farm
    #     Materials, so the block is absent and their pictures are unchanged.
    #
    #   WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. SHOT 2026-09-13, 946x633, TWO takes — and the second take
    #     exists because the first found a defect that no assertion in this repo could have
    #     seen. Every sentence was correct, every number was real, and the block was a wall.
    #       (a) **The unknown-standing sentence was thirty words, and there are eight rows.**
    #           "…no skill-up in your log yet. EQBuddy reads your standing from the game's own
    #           'You have become better at…' line, so it starts from your next one." — eight
    #           times, one after another, in the default state that every player sees first.
    #           Distinct-count is the tell in prose exactly as it is in data (trap 73): eight
    #           rows carrying one distinct sentence is a template, and the fact it states
    #           belongs to the BLOCK. Fixed with `HelperPresentation.ProfessionLearnNote`, said
    #           once under the picker; the row is now "Baking — no skill-up in your log yet."
    #       (b) **The park note had no margin of its own**, so it butted against the last row's
    #           two links and read as belonging to that profession rather than to the block.
    #           A caveat attached to the wrong subject is worse than one nobody reads.
    #     Everything else was as predicted: the goals face names the one pick, the profession
    #     face reads "Baking · Blacksmithing" in the curated order, the Baking row prints no
    #     zero, Blacksmithing reads "raised it to 122, on Sep 13" (the appended line's own
    #     stamp), both rows carry "Watch skill-ups" and "eqlwiki" and neither says "Watching",
    #     no recommendation is drawn, and the deferral names the missing half under it. The
    #     open picker holds the eight in curated order, none ticked, Blacksmithing reading 122.
    #     No safety or difficulty vocabulary anywhere in the block.
    #
    # ---- E-3 PR 5: the LIVE room, and the Raids move ---------------------------------
    #
    # Same illustration lock: a room's shot lands in the PR that lands the room, exactly the
    # way its rail row does. Title is 'EQBuddy — Live', derived from ShellPages.Label — trap
    # 53 applies, and it should indeed fail rather than photograph something else if the room
    # is renamed.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-live' — native chrome and the title row as every shell shot has, with the rail
    #     now SIX rows in RailOrder: Home (tray), LIVE (bolt), Progress (chart), Gear (bag),
    #     Quests (quest), World (pin). **Live must sit BETWEEN Home and Progress** — the rail
    #     walks RailOrder filtering by Landed, so this is correct by construction and would
    #     look identical to a healthy build if it silently were not, which is the whole reason
    #     this line is written down. Live lit, the other five dim.
    #     The room: a session report at the top — "This sitting — <fixture zone>" in accent
    #     ink with a facts line under it (elapsed · N kills · dps), then a SIX-chip wrapped
    #     strip Damage · Healing · Pet · Timeline · Kills · Raids carrying their real badges,
    #     Damage lit. Under it the Damage body: the title "Your damage", a subtext line, the
    #     compact Fight/Session toggle with **Session** selected (the room is about the
    #     sitting; the floating breakout defaults the other way, deliberately), the four-chip
    #     sort strip, the Combat card's own summary lines, and the ability bar rows.
    #     **And one thing that must NOT be there**: a "0 deaths" anywhere in the report. The
    #     one number whose absence is the good news is omitted rather than printed as a zero,
    #     and a picture is the only thing that can confirm an absence like that.
    #   'shell-live-raids' — the same frame addressed straight to a room inside the room, and
    #     the DESTINATION half of the Raids move (the departure half is `shell-progress`
    #     showing three chips). Raids chip lit, badged "0 / 21".
    #     THE BODY IS THE EMPTY STATE, and that is the prediction rather than a miss: this
    #     shot seeds no raid-kills.json (that is 'raids-card' / 'raids-import'), so what
    #     shows is "Nothing defeated yet …" plus the ⧉ copy of /outputfile achievements.
    #     That button is the thing worth photographing here — the room reuses the real
    #     RaidsCardView, so "a surface that needs an in-game command must SHIP the command"
    #     survived a SECOND host change for free, and trap 34's whole lesson is that a
    #     missing affordance is invisible to everything except a picture or a must-list.
    #     (The predecessor shot, 'shell-progress-raids', predicted a ledger and was wrong for
    #     the same reason; the note is carried rather than re-learned.)
    #   'shell-live-timeline' — the tab that is a CANVAS rather than a list, which is the one
    #     layout claim in this room no unit test can make. Predicted: the fight name and its
    #     "m:ss · N events · peak N dps @ m:ss" line, a DPS graph 96 units tall, and under it
    #     the lanes filling the rest of the cell — a lane per skill with the 176-unit name
    #     gutter on the left. **No vertical scrollbar**: the room disables that scroller for
    #     this tab so the canvas gets the viewport instead of an infinite measure. If a
    #     scrollbar is there, the canvas is being measured with infinite height and the lanes
    #     are the wrong size (trap 36's arithmetic, on the axis that hides).
    'shell-live'      = @{ Title = 'EQBuddy — Live'
                           Env = @{ EQBUDDY_SHELL = 'live' }; Set = @{} }
    'shell-live-raids' = @{ Title = 'EQBuddy — Live'

                           Env = @{ EQBUDDY_SHELL = 'live:timeline' }; Set = @{} }
    # ---- OE-6: the first-run Setup screen --------------------------------------------
    #
    # **The staging is the whole shot, and it is INVERTED from every row above it.** The
    # batch profile now carries `SetupDismissed = $true` (see Write-Settings) precisely
    # because it is otherwise the profile Setup opens for — so this row is the one place
    # that has to put the screen BACK. It does it through `EQBUDDY_SETUP=1`, a forced open,
    # rather than by seeding `SetupDismissed = $false` and relying on the predicate: the
    # picture is then evidence about the SCREEN rather than about whether the dumps
    # happened to be absent this run, and it keeps working on the day the fixture gains one.
    # (The predicate itself is asserted where an assertion belongs — `SetupReadoutTests` for
    # the rule, `ShellHostTests` for the auto-launch reaching a running app.)
    #
    # Title is 'EQBuddy — Character': Setup is a LAYER over the active room and not a
    # room, so the window's title is the room underneath — which is itself half of what this
    # picture proves. Trap 53 applies as it does to every row here: if a rename makes this
    # title stale the row fails rather than photographing something else — which is exactly
    # what DRA-66's rename did, and why this row changed in the same diff as the label.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the shot (trap 23):
    #   'setup-screen' — a native title bar reading "EQBuddy — Character" and the rail
    #     on the left with Character lit, both UNCHANGED and both visible: the screen
    #     covers the ROOM cell only. Where the four Home blocks would be, an opaque panel with a hairline
    #     border and rounded corners, inset by one card pad, holding:
    #       "Set EQBuddy up" in accent ink at window-title size, one wrapped paragraph under
    #       it, then the small-caps heading "What EQBuddy is waiting for" and THREE rows —
    #       Bags, Achievements, Factions — each with "Not run yet" in accent ink on the
    #       right, a dim line saying what it feeds, and a ⧉ copy button under it.
    #       **Three buttons. Not two, not zero** — the batch profile stages no dumps, and a
    #       screen that asked for output files without handing over the commands is the
    #       defect David reported on 2026-08-20 (trap 34), which nothing but a picture or a
    #       must-list can see.
    #     Then a "Got it" button and, under it, one dim line naming BOTH ways back (Home
    #     keeps asking; Settings → Behavior → Setup re-opens this). If that line is missing,
    #     the one close on this screen is a permanent one with nothing saying so.
    #     The column is capped at MinRoomWidth and pinned LEFT, the same cap Home's blocks
    #     take — if the paragraph runs the full width of a wide window, the cap has come off.
    'setup-screen'    = @{ Title = 'EQBuddy — Character'
                           Env = @{ EQBUDDY_SHELL = '1'; EQBUDDY_SETUP = '1' }; Set = @{} }
    # ---- TR-1: the one-time EQBuddy 1.x profile import question ------------------------
    #
    # The illustration lock: an illustration of our own UI is a capture with a recipe, and
    # this surface lands in the PR that lands it. Checked docs/screenshots/ and grepped docs/
    # for 'import-consent' first (trap 21): nothing.
    #
    # It is the ONLY shot in this file whose window is not the widget, a satellite or a
    # room — it is a startup MODAL, asked before AppSettings.Load and therefore before
    # anything else in the app exists (ProfileImportStartup says why that ordering is not
    # negotiable). So the capture waits for a window nothing else will have opened, and the
    # teardown is the batch's own Stop-Hard rather than a WM_CLOSE to a widget that was
    # never built.
    #
    # `V1Profile` is what makes the question reachable at all — see Write-V1Profile: it
    # moves this batch's settings.json into a FAKE v1 profile and empties the Evolved one,
    # because the import refuses a non-empty target and would otherwise stage the refusal
    # instead of the offer (trap 23). EQBUDDY_IMPORT_CONSENT is deliberately NOT set: with
    # it set there would be no dialog to photograph.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the shot (trap 23/51): a NATIVE title bar reading "EQBuddy
    # — Import from EQBuddy 1.x" (not a bare "EQBuddy" — trap 24 inside one process, and not
    # a frameless widget-style box, which is the least trustworthy frame for "may I copy
    # your profile"). Headline "You already have EQBuddy 1.x" in the accent ink, the lead
    # under it, then a TICKED box reading "Bring my EQBuddy 1.x settings and history over"
    # — ticked is door D2's stated assumption and the one thing in this picture a reader
    # should check first. Two dim lines under it: "copied, never moved … EQBuddy 1.x keeps
    # working" and the start-fresh sentence. Then "What would come over", a volume line
    # reading "2 files · <a few KB>", and exactly TWO manifest rows — quest-ledger.json and
    # settings.json — because that is what Write-V1Profile stages and nothing else. One
    # button, "Continue", left-aligned. **What must NOT be there: any widget, any shell
    # window, and any second EQBuddy in the taskbar** — the app has not got that far.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-07, 506x307. Every prediction above held, including the two manifest rows

    # DEFAULT palette. It now reads the palette from the SOURCE v1 profile — the player's
    # own EQBuddy, which is the only honest answer available at that moment and the right one
    # on a screen whose job is to say "you already have EQBuddy 1.x". So -Theme reaches this
    # shot through the staged v1 settings.json, and the owner's ~3:45 PM CT teal+grey lock
    # applies to it like every other row. Re-shot under it; teal accent, dark grey ground,
    # nothing else moved.

    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23):
    #
    #   'shell-live-pace' — the same 'EQBuddy — Live' chrome and six-row rail as
    #     'shell-live', and an EIGHT-chip wrapped strip: Damage · Healing · Pet · Timeline ·
    #     PACE · ENCOUNTERS · Kills · Raids. **Pace must sit between Timeline and
    #     Encounters** — narrowest scope first — and it must NOT read "Timeline", which is
    #     the whole signed §3 refusal and the one thing this picture can disprove that a
    #     unit test cannot make obvious: two chips, two different words, on one strip, an
    #     inch apart.
    #     Pace lit, badged "peak N dps" from the fixture's own timeline.
    #     The body: a dim caption "DPS over time — peak N/s (h:mm PM–h:mm PM, per minute)"
    #     over a 120-unit panel-backed frame carrying ONE accent polyline. Nothing else —
    #     no lanes, no gutter, no names. That is the difference from 'shell-live-timeline'
    #     photographed rather than described, and the two pictures side by side are the
    #     argument for the rename.
    #     **What must NOT be there**: the "Not enough of this sitting has happened…" empty
    #     line. The caption, the frame and that line are one switch (trap 17), so a picture
    #     with both is a pair that has drifted apart.
    #   'shell-live-encounters' — the same frame with Encounters lit, badged "N pulls".
    #     The body is a list of COLLAPSED rows, oldest first, each "▸ <creature> — h:mm tt ·
    #     N dmg · N dps · Ns · took N" with a dim ⧉ beside it. No row is open on first
    #     paint, and the ⧉ is the thing worth photographing: it is the fourth caller of
    #     `FightExport.ToText`, and a missing affordance is invisible to a diff, a build and
    #     a test alike (trap 34).
    #     A vertical scrollbar is EXPECTED here and not on Pace — the room's scroller is
    #     Auto for both, and this is the tab with real overflow.
    #   'shell-progress-history' — 'EQBuddy — Progress' chrome, rail of six with Progress
    #     lit, and a FOUR-chip strip: Experience · Wealth · Faction · HISTORY. That fourth
    #     chip is the picture's point: it is the first tab in `ProgressSurface` that only
    #     one host draws, so a phone screenshot or a v1 `ProgressWindow` shot taken the same
    #     day must show THREE and four respectively — the two shots together are what says
    #     `DesktopShellOnly` is wired and not merely written.
    #     History lit, badged "3 sittings" from the three primed sessions.
    #     The body is a LIST BESIDE A DETAIL PANE — the first time Progress has needed the
    #     second axis (`RoomSinglePane`, Bevel §4's predict-before-shoot). Left: "3
    #     sessions" over three two-line rows, newest first, each "<Day> <Mon d>, <h:mm tt> —
    #     West Commonlands" over "0h NNm · N kills · N% xp · <coin>".
    #     **The zone and the duration are DERIVED, not invented** — this shot replays the
    #     one shared fixture log, so its zone is the fixture's (West Commonlands, never a
    #     zone of one's choosing) and its span is the fixture's own compressed hour. The
    #     first draft of this block guessed "Lower Guk" and "2h 14m" and the shot came back
    #     disagreeing with its own prediction on two literals that were never predictions at
    #     all. That is trap 23's tripwire firing on noise: a prediction you did not derive
    #     costs the next reader a real investigation, because the honest response to a
    #     mismatch is to suspect the fixture. Predict the SHAPE and only those literals the
    #     staging actually pins. The DATES are `ShiftDays` behind the run day and so are
    #     unpinnable by construction. Right, with nothing picked: the
    #     ladders block — "Character progress — every stored session" in small caps, a level
    #     caption "Level 22 → 24 (…, 3 dings)" over an accent staircase, an AA caption over
    #     a green one — and under it the dim studio-pointer paragraph naming
    #     "Session history…".
    #     **The ladders are the half that can be wrong and look right**: they need dings
    #     across MORE THAN ONE stored session, which is exactly what the three primes are
    #     for, and an unprimed profile would render a correct picture of an empty career.
    #     Primed under the FIXTURE'S OWN character for the reason 'progress-levelups'
    #     already records: `SessionSummary.Stored` compares (server, character) with SQL
    #     `=`, so rows under any other name are rows this surface can never match.

    # PREDICTION, written before the shot: the GOALS face names both rather than counting —
    # "Unlock Classes · Unlock Races" is 29 characters against the Helper's 34-char budget,
    # and the order is the enum's, not the click order. Under it one block headed "Races and
    # classes you are unlocking", its note, and a face reading "Human (Freeport)" — one pick
    # is always named, never counted.
    # The open popup holds THREE rows in closest-to-done order, each with its own count:
    # Human (Freeport) — 0 of 2 done, Barbarian — 0 of 1 done, Warrior — 0 of 1 done (ties
    # break alphabetically, so Barbarian precedes Human precedes Warrior). The FACTION
    # sub-picker is absent: Work on Faction is not among the picked goals.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-13: as predicted — the goals face names both, the block and its note are
    # there, the face reads the one pick, and the popup holds Barbarian · Human (Freeport) ·
    # Warrior in that order with Human ticked. The ANSWERS under it were not predicted and
    # are the better half of the picture: Warrior survives the race pick (its section is
    # untouched) and the Human (Freeport) unlock is headed **West Commonlands** rather than
    # by its own name, because the fixture's kills move Coalition of Tradesfolk and the
    # cross-domain join gave that unlock a place to go. Barbarian is absent, which is the
    # pick firing. The popup overlaps the source note behind it, which is a dropdown doing
    # what a dropdown does.
    #
    # AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: 'shell-helper', 'shell-helper-narrow' and
    # 'shell-helper-picker' all change in this slice, because none of them picks a goal and
    # "nothing picked" weighs every goal — so the new block is drawn in its honest no-dump
    # state, with the ⧉ that fills it. That is the fifth copy button
    # `TheHelperHandsOverTheCommandsItsOwnEmptyStatesAskFor` now asserts. The other
    # 'shell-helper*' shots pick goals that are not unlock goals, so the block is absent and
    # their pictures are unchanged.

    # ---- DRA-71 D6: Farm Gear asks the intent first --------------------------------------
    #
    # The three staged states are the three claims the slice makes: the intent strip with its
    # answers, the worn picker OPEN, and the OTHER intent producing a different top zone from
    # the SAME profile.
    #
    # The anchors are staged through the real seam — an inventory dump beside the log, in the
    # game's own tab-separated shape — and both item names are REAL rows in the shipped
    # catalog with no class lock on them ("Cloth Cap", AC 2, HEAD; "Cloth Choker", AC 1, NECK).
    # A made-up item would resolve to no stats, drop out of `GearUpgrades.WornFrom`, and the
    # picture would be the honest empty state of something else (trap 23).
    #
    # PREDICTION, computed against the shipped catalog before the run and confirmed by the E2E
    # rows that assert the same numbers: the fixture infers WARRIOR, so the class lock is WAR.
    # 'shell-helper-gear' — one block headed "Farm Gear": its note, a three-segment strip with
    #   "Upgrade what I wear" selected, a worn face reading "Cloth Cap" (one pick is always
    #   named), the "Include quest rewards" pill UNSELECTED, and the catalog caveat under it.
    #   The answers are THREE zones in this order — Temple of Veeshan (3 upgrades), Clan
    #   Runnyeye (2), Kael Drakkel (1) — each naming its items with "+N AC/HP/…" and the
    #   estimate label, the room cap saying 2 more answers matched, and the sweep's own cap
    #   saying 103 more upgrades are not listed with a Gear door under it.
    # 'shell-helper-gear-picker' — the same state with the WORN picker open over it. Two check
    #   rows in slot order — "Cloth Cap — head" ticked, "Cloth Choker — neck" not — because
    #   the popup offers every worn item and the offer is never narrowed by its own filter.
    #   Popups = $true composites the popup's own HWND (trap 79); without it this shot is
    #   byte-identical to the one above.
    # 'shell-helper-gear-replace' — SOLARIZED, and the same stored pick. No picker at all (that
    #   is the intent difference made visible), and the top zone changes to Western Wastes,
    #   which feeds eight of the NECK upgrades — so the picture shows the two intents being
    #   different questions rather than two labels on one answer. 225 held back.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-13: all three as predicted — the strip, the selected segment, the face, the
    # unselected pill, the caveat, the zone order and the item sentences with their estimate
    # labels; the picker composites its two rows in slot order with Cloth Cap ticked, and the
    # replace shot's top zone is Western Wastes with no picker above it.
    #
    # THREE THINGS THE PREDICTIONS DID NOT COVER, and the third is the one worth acting on:
    #   (a) The per-row cap is visible only in the REPLACE shot — "5 more reasons not shown."
    #       under Western Wastes, which is 8 upgrades minus the 3 named. In the other two no
    #       zone had more than three, so trap 50's sentence had nothing to say. That is the cap
    #       behaving, and it took the third staging to photograph it at all.
    #   (b) The unknown-level line is drawn above the answers in all three, with its Character
    #       door — the shoot profile has no ding and no statement. Correct, and a reminder that
    #       Farm Gear is EXEMPT from level: the line says the ranking is unaffected, and for
    #       this goal that is literally true.
    #   (c) **THE BLOCK IS TALL, AND THE TWO CAP SENTENCES FALL BELOW THE FOLD** at this
    #       window size. The note, the strip, the picker, the pill and the four-line catalog
    #       caveat come before the first answer, so "2 more answers matched" and "103 more
    #       upgrades are not listed" are off-screen in every one of the three. They are drawn —
    #       `helperGearWithheld` asserts the number from the same Build — and a player scrolls
    #       to them. It is a density question rather than a defect, and it is filed in
    #       `BEVEL.md` against these shots rather than restyled here.

    #     and the only difference is the block this slice adds.
    #
    #   THE STAGED GOALS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT IN TODAY'S ANSWERS. A Blade of Carnage and a
    #   Wurmslayer are not upgrades over a Cloth Cap in HEAD or a Cloth Choker in NECK, so the
    #   sweep below offers neither — which is exactly the state the slice exists for. A shot
    #   staged so that the block and the answers named the same item would photograph the easy
    #   case and say nothing about the hard one (trap 23: a wrong-shape staging photographs a
    #   real state of something else).
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23), before the take:
    #     * A block headed "What you are going after", ABOVE "Worth doing next" and below the
    #       Farm Gear block — the room's own order, because a goal outlives the list under it.
    #     * Its note, saying the two things it does NOT claim: nothing ticks itself off, and
    #       EQBuddy has no numbers for what a "+N" adds to either side.
    #     * TWO rows, NEWEST FIRST — Wurmslayer (17 Sep) above Blade of Carnage (15 Sep) —
    #       each naming what it replaces and its slot, each with "Tracked ✓" and a Gear door.
    #     * Every item line under the answers gains a "Track" of its own, and NONE of them
    #       reads "Tracked ✓", because neither staged goal is in today's list.
    #
    #   THE HEIGHT IS PART OF THE STAGING, for 'shell-helper-gear-who''s own reason one block
    #   along: this slice adds a heading, a four-line note and two rows ABOVE the answers, so at
    #   the default 946x633 the Track controls this shot is half about would be below the fold.

    #
    #   'shell-helper-gear-band' — 'shell-helper-gear' with ONE thing added: a stated level in
    #     the ledger. That is the picture the Founder's acceptance 3 asks for, and the pairing
    #     is what makes it evidence: the three shots above leave the level UNKNOWN, so their
    #     gate stands down and they are the SAME room with the gate off. Put the two side by
    #     side and the difference is the whole slice.
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23) — computed from `ZoneLevelBands.json` before the take, and the same
    #   prediction the E2E row `TheBandGateRefusesTheZonesOutsideYourLevelAndSaysSo` makes:
    #     * The level readout says 28, source "you told EQBuddy".
    #     * THREE answers, and the top one CHANGES from Temple of Veeshan to Clan Runnyeye —
    #       Clan Runnyeye (2 upgrades), Kael Drakkel, Tower of Frozen Shadow.
    #     * Temple of Veeshan `60+` and Veeshan's Peak `60+` are GONE: bottom 60 is 32 over 28,
    #       which is the BOTTOM arm. Kael Drakkel `30-60+` survives (bottom 30 is 2 over, and an
    #       open top has no maximum to be under); Tower of Frozen Shadow `26-51` contains 28;
    #       Clan Runnyeye has no band at all and an unanswered question gates nothing.
    #     * A caption naming both numbers and the source: "2 zones EQBuddy has upgrades for are
    #       not listed at your level 28: Temple of Veeshan (60 and above), Veeshan's Peak (60 and
    #       above). Those are eqlwiki's own creature levels…" with a Gear door under it.
    #
    #   THE HEIGHT IS PART OF THE STAGING, and it is here for a reason worth reading. The first
    #   take used the default 946x633 and was a correct, well-composed photograph of a room with
    #   the feature OFF-SCREEN: the source note, the level note and the vendor caveat come before
    #   the first answer, so a caption under three answers falls below the fold — the same
    #   density finding already filed in `BEVEL.md` against the three shots above. A shot of a
    #   refusal that does not show the refusal proves nothing (trap 22's shape: a surface with no
    #   reviewable state). `EQBUDDY_SHELL_SIZE` opens the window tall enough to contain it.
    #   **That is a staging choice and NOT a claim the caption fits a default window** — it does
    #   not, and the density question stays with Bevel rather than being restyled from here.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: none. Every other 'shell-helper*' shot leaves the level
    #     unknown or picks a goal that is not Farm Gear, so the gate cannot fire in any of them —
    #     which is exactly why this one has to seed a level to say anything at all.

    # ---- DRA-84 D4: every drop row saying WHO, and the ones that could not -----------------
    #
    #   'shell-helper-gear-who' — the Founder's acceptance item 2 in a picture, and item 3's
    #     second mechanism beside it. A DIFFERENT anchor from the four shots above, chosen
    #     because it is the one in the shipped catalog that makes both halves visible at once:
    #     a warrior in AC-2 `Cloth Gloves` on the REPLACE intent.
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23) — computed against the shipped `ItemCatalog.json.gz` before the take,
    #   and the same prediction the E2E row
    #   `AnUpgradeNothingCanNameADropperForIsWithheldAndTheRoomSaysSo` makes:
    #     * THREE answers — Temple of Veeshan (3 upgrades), Kael Drakkel (2), Dragon Necropolis
    #       (1) — and "3 more answers matched" under them.
    #     * SIX item lines, and every one of them names a creature, which is the half that read
    #       as empty on the build the Founder failed: Vulak`Aerr, Lendiniara the Keeper and Lord
    #       Vyemm under Temple of Veeshan; King Tormax and Yetarr under Kael Drakkel.
    #     * THE PLURAL CLAUSE is the Dragon Necropolis line and it is the reason this anchor was
    #       picked: *"Flayed Paebala Gloves beats the Cloth Gloves in your hands — +15 DEX. a
    #       Chetari master, a Chetari dominator and Dominator Yisaki drop it."* Three names, one
    #       verb, one sentence. The four shots above happen to name one creature apiece.
    #     * "5 more drop offers are not listed: their item pages name nothing that drops them
    #       in those zones…", with a Gear door under it. **All five are one record** — `Slime Blood of
    #       Cazic-Thule`, whose DropZones the promoter parsed out of a bulleted wiki line as
    #       `Plane of Fear<br>`, `:* Fright`, `:* Dread`, `:* Terror` and `:* Cazic Thule (God)
    #       (needs confirmation)`. So this picture is also the evidence for the promoter defect
    #       filed in `FABLE.md`: before D4 those five strings were five recommended CAMPS.
    #     * "89 more upgrades matched and are not listed" — the sweep's own cap, a DIFFERENT
    #       number with a different cause, which is why the two sentences are separate.
    #     * The unknown-level line above the answers with its Character door: no ding and no
    #       statement in this profile, so the band gate stands down and nothing here is about it.
    #
    #   THE HEIGHT IS PART OF THE STAGING, for the reason 'shell-helper-gear-band' records: the
    #   two withheld captions come AFTER three answers, so at the default 946x633 this would be a
    #   well-composed photograph of the feature off-screen. The density question stays with
    #   Bevel and is not restyled from here.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: all four 'shell-helper-gear*' shots above change in this
    #     slice — every one of their item lines gains a creature clause it did not have. That is
    #     the slice working, and they are re-taken in the same change.
    #
    #   **946x880 → 946x1080 in DRA-219**, and the re-take is what found it. That slice adds two
    #   captions to this same block (*"82 better base items are not listed at all"* and *"21
    #   better base items come only from quests"* — this fixture has the toggle OFF), which
    #   pushed the who caption this shot exists FOR below the fold. The picture stayed
    #   well-composed and stopped being of the feature, which is the paragraph above happening a
    #   second time rather than a new lesson.

    #     include-quests toggle ON, on a DIFFERENT anchor: a warrior in an AC-4
    #     `Cape of Underfoot`.
    #
    #   WHY NOT THE GLOVES. The first draft reused this file's `Cloth Gloves` and was predicted
    #   from a sweep with NO class. In the app, which knows the character is a warrior, the
    #   class-lock filter removes every quest-sourced glove before the per-anchor cap is
    #   reached — so the picture would have been a well-composed photograph of three zone rows,
    #   i.e. of the feature being absent. The fixture moved, not the number (trap 23, and the
    #   same lesson `mobile-helper-gear` records one surface over).
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23) — computed against the shipped `ItemCatalog.json.gz` AND
    #   `QuestCatalog.json` before the take, with `MyClasses = ["WAR"]`, and the same prediction
    #   the E2E row `QuestSourcedUpgradesAnswerTheSixQuestionsAndTheirRefusalsAreCountedApart`
    #   makes:
    #     * THREE answers: Temple of Veeshan (3 cloaks), then two QUESTS — `Aid the Dar Brood`
    #       and `Deck of Spontaneous Generation Quest`.
    #     * THE SENTENCE THIS SHOT EXISTS FOR, first on each quest row: *"eqlwiki has Aid the Dar
    #       Brood starting with Harla Dar in Western Wastes from level 60. It takes 1 turn-in
    #       item — Frakadar's Talisman."* Before this slice that row was the quest's NAME and an
    #       item line, and nothing else.
    #     * THE SECOND QUEST ROW CARRIES NO COMPONENT CLAUSE — *"eqlwiki has Deck of Spontaneous
    #       Generation Quest starting with Ferjeneror in Plane of Mischief from level 46."* — and
    #       that is the trap-73 half of the feature ON SCREEN: its page lists no turn-in items, so
    #       nothing is drawn rather than a zero. Predicting the blank is the point.
    #     * A MAP BUTTON on each quest row, beside Quests and Gear, pointing at the START ZONE
    #       (Western Wastes; Plane of Mischief) — the S11.2 door a hand-in could never offer
    #       until the quest catalog was joined.
    #     * FOUR captions under the answers, and the point of the shot is that they are four
    #       different numbers with four different causes: *"2 more answers matched your goals"*
    #       (the room's own list cap), *"8 more upgrades matched"* (the sweep's per-anchor cap),
    #       *"5 more quest rewards are not listed"* (the new rule — the shipped quest list does
    #       not hold the quests those item pages name), and *"6 better base items are not listed
    #       at all"* (no page names a zone OR a quest for them). The last two have doors of their
    #       own — Quests and Gear — because the lists they point at are different lists.
    #     * NO who-rule caption and NO band or era sentence: every page this anchor reaches names
    #       a creature, and the level is unknown so both gates stand down.
    #     * NO "5 better base items come only from quests" line, because the toggle is ON here.
    #       That caption belongs to the DEFAULT screen and the E2E row
    #       `WithQuestsOffTheRoomCountsTheUpgradesTheToggleIsHiding` is where it is pinned.
    #
    #   THE HEIGHT IS PART OF THE STAGING, for the reason 'shell-helper-gear-band' records: the
    #   captions come AFTER three answers, two of which now carry a six-question line as well as
    #   their item lines.
    #
    #   AND THE REGRESSION PICTURES: every 'shell-helper-gear*' shot above gains the quest-only
    #     caption in this slice, because all of them have the toggle off. They are re-taken in

    # ---- DRA-149 D5: the FOUNDER'S OWN DUMP, and the two halves of FAIL 3 ------------------
    #
    #   'shell-helper-founder' — the picture of the whole card. HIS dump, copied verbatim from
    #     `tests/fixtures/inventory/dranak.txt` (the `DumpFrom` key exists for this), at HIS
    #     level 29, on the intent he failed. Every other Helper shot in this file stages a
    #     two-item fixture whose point is the shape; this one stages the thing that broke.
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23) — measured against the shipped catalog before the take, and the
    #   same numbers `FounderResmokeTests` and the E2E row
    #   `TheFoundersOwnDumpReachesTheHelperWithCandidatesAndRefusals` pin:
    #     * The worn face reads "Any worn item" — nothing picked, so the sweep runs over all
    #       TWENTY-ONE of his readable rows. (The tests say 20 anchors because they exclude
    #       AMMO; the room counts what it drew.)
    #     * NO "EQBuddy has never read about:" caption. That caption is D2's and it ships — it
    #       is what would have told him his bow had vanished. On HIS dump it is correctly
    #       absent, because after the alias nothing is unreadable, and **predicting the blank is
    #       the point**: a correct absence is indistinguishable from a missing feature.
    #     * THREE answers — Kael Drakkel, Great Divide, Clan Runnyeye — places a 29 can stand
    #       in, each with item lines naming their creatures.
    #     * THE SENTENCE THIS SHOT EXISTS FOR, under them: *"18 zones EQBuddy has upgrades for
    #       are not listed at your level 29: Chardok (50 and up), … and 13 more. Those are
    #       eqlwiki's own creature levels — EQBuddy leaves a zone out of this list when its band
    #       starts 5 or more levels over you."* Temple of Veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb, Plane of
    #       Fear, Plane of Hate and Veeshan's Peak are all in that list. **It reads like a
    #       failure and is the fix working**, which is exactly why it is photographed and why
    #       `docs/ops/dra149-founder-resmoke.md` leads with it.
    #     * "8 more drop offers are not listed: their item pages name nothing that drops them in
    #       those zones" — the who rule, a DIFFERENT number with a different cause, which is why
    #       it is a second sentence.
    #     * "1,190 more upgrades matched and are not listed" — the sweep's own cap, a third
    #       cause and a third sentence. Three withheld numbers in one picture is the density
    #       question this shot puts to Bevel; it is not restyled from here.
    #     * The base-claim line: *"a better BASE item than yours — at the same +, it wins"*,
    #       said ONCE for the block. Not once per row — eight item lines carrying one caveat
    #       apiece is trap 73 in prose, and D1 chose the block.
    #     * NO unknown-level line and no Character door: the level is stated, so the disclosure
    #       says where the 29 came from instead.
    #
    #   WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND THE CAVEAT THIS SHOT SHIPS WITH. Taken 2026-09-17. Every
    #   prediction above is met — "Any worn item", the base claim said once, "Weighed at level
    #   29, set by you", Kael Drakkel / Great Divide / Clan Runnyeye in that order, creature
    #   clauses on every item line including a plural one ("a furious tizmak warrior, a tizmak
    #   champion and a tizmak warrior drop it"), and no unread-worn caption. **The three withheld
    #   captions are BELOW THE FOLD and this picture does not show them.** The shell window
    #   clamps near 885px tall on a 1080 screen whatever `EQBUDDY_SHELL_SIZE` asks for — a first
    #   take at `946x1000` came back 932x993 with the bottom ~110px black and the content ending
    #   mid-sentence at the same place. So the sentence this shot was chosen to photograph is
    #   the one it cannot reach, which is stated here rather than worked around by restyling the
    #   product (trap 79's rule: say which part of a capture is unfaithful). `shell-helper-
    #   founder-bow` below is the picture that DOES show a refusal caption whole, and the
    #   numbers themselves are asserted by `FounderResmokeTests` and the E2E row, which is where
    #   a caption below a fold cannot hide.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-founder-bow' — the same dump and the same level, NARROWED to the bow, with
    #     include-quests ON. Short enough that the captions fit, and it is a state worth its own
    #     picture: every place the one anchor's upgrades drop is refused, so the room draws the
    #     refusal AND `EveryZoneOutsideYourBand` — which exists precisely because
    #     `NoCatalogUpgrade` would be a lie there.
    #
    #   MEASURED, AND IT CORRECTS THE PLAN'S WORKED EXAMPLE. P6 predicted four base-better items
    #   for the bow, and there are — but **only for a character who is both a Ranger and a
    #   Shaman**, which is nobody. The class lock decides: `Bow of the Silver Fang` (Temple of
    #   Veeshan) is `RNG` only and `Rune Shafted Harpoon` (The Mighty Snowfang Hero) is `SHM`
    #   only, while the two Velium Reinforced bows in Sleeper's Tomb are `WAR|PAL|RNG|SHD|ROG`.
    #   So the fixture character sees **one** refused zone, not two, and no quest row at all.
    #   The four-item figure in `FounderResmokeTests` is measured with NO class lock and is a
    #   fact about the CATALOG; what any real character sees is a subset of it, and the picture
    #   is what made the difference visible.
    #
    #   'shell-helper-vendors' — FAIL 3's second half, which has no picture anywhere else.
    #     Farm Materials picked and NO profession picked, which is the filter's empty state and
    #     therefore all eight — so this is also the density question for the vendor sub-list,
    #     asked at its worst case rather than its best.
    #       - Under each profession's standing row and its two controls: up to THREE shop lines,
    #         one per zone, in eqlwiki's own words with the zone in front. Jewelcrafting reads
    #         Ak'Anon, Cabilis, Erudin — the catalog's own order, never ranked.
    #       - "and 14 more zones — eqlwiki's zone pages have the rest." under Jewelcrafting. The
    #         cap says what it held back (trap 50) and counts ZONES, because that is what a
    #         player deciding where to travel is choosing between.
    #       - TWO doors under each line — `eqlwiki` and `Map` — which is six controls under one
    #         profession, and the second thing this shot asks Bevel about.
    #       - NO profession draws the "No zone page's map key names a … shop" sentence on the
    #         current catalog: all eight match at least one zone. If one appears in this
    #         picture, a keyword row has been lost.
    #       - The block caption under the whole list: *"Shops eqlwiki's zone maps name, in the
    #         wiki's own words — EQBuddy matched them on each profession's materials and tools
    #         and changed nothing else."*
    #
    #   'shell-helper-vendors-light' — the same staging in SOLARIZED, the only light palette.
    #     Twenty-four transcribed caption lines with two accent links each is a new density for
    #     this room and light is where dim-on-light contrast fails.
    #   **946x880 → 946x1240 in DRA-219, fixing a PRE-EXISTING crop rather than one that slice
    #   caused.** The recipe above promises *"THE SENTENCE THIS SHOT EXISTS FOR, under them: 18
    #   zones EQBuddy has upgrades for are not listed at your level 29…"*, and in the committed
    #   picture that sentence was below the fold — verified by pixel-diffing the re-take against
    #   `HEAD`: 122 rows differ and all of them are scrollbar, so the crop predates this change.
    #   A picture that contradicts its own recipe is the illustration lock failing quietly, so it
    #   is corrected in the change that re-takes it. Nothing about the STAGING moved. **The
    #   capture comes back 932x1093 rather than 1240** — the shell is clamped to the desk it is
    #   shot on, which is why this asks for more than it needs rather than for the exact figure.
    #   At 1093 the band sentence and the who sentence are both on screen; the two DRA-219
    #   captions under them are not, and they have their own shot.

    # ---- DRA-71 D7: motes and money, both from the player's own play ----------------------
    #
    # The two staged states are this slice's two claims: what a place has paid you in MOTES,
    # and what it has paid you in COIN and in things you sold. Both are ranked from evidence
    # only — the shipped catalog names no real zone for a mote ("Various Zones" on all eleven
    # records) and its vendor prices are quoted at somebody else's Charisma — so there is no
    # catalog state to stage and no catalog sentence to photograph.
    #
    # EVERYTHING GOES THROUGH THE LOG, which is the point of the staging. `Prime` runs the app
    # over the fixture and closes it gracefully so the sitting finalizes into history.db; the
    # extra `Lines` are the real log grammar for the real parsers — a zone line, a consider, the
    # kills, the mote loot, the coin, and one vendor sale. Nothing is seeded into a store.
    #
    # THE FIFTY KILLS ARE NOT DECORATION. `MoteHistory.MinKills` is 50: under it the fold
    # quotes no rate at all, because one lucky Infinite mote in a real hour is thirty potency
    # an hour that will never happen again. A shot staged with six kills would photograph the
    # honest empty state and look exactly like a broken engine (trap 23). They are generated
    # rather than typed so the count is a number somebody can read and change.
    #
    # THE ZONE IS "Najena - Solo", and the name is the only input: `InstanceTier.FromZoneName`
    # reads D0 off it, which is OUTSIDE the D2-D4 band the mote engine prefers, so the tier
    # preference fires and draws its sentence. An open-world zone would photograph the engine
    # with one of its three criteria invisible.
    #
    # PREDICTION for 'shell-helper-motes' — one answer, "Najena - Solo", serving Farm Motes and
    #   Make Money (the cross-domain join firing on one place, which is the whole room). Under
    #   it: the mote rate with its count and its scope; the coin rate through the one coin
    #   formatter; "Bone Chips drops here from a shadowed man … and a vendor has paid you …";
    #   the tier sentence saying EQBuddy ranks motes toward D2-D4 so this one sits lower; and
    #   the vendor-price note under the answers. The unknown-level line is drawn above them
    #   with its Character door, as it is in every shot of this room — the shoot profile has
    #   no ding. The RATES are the fixture's own arithmetic over a compressed hour and are NOT
    #   predicted (the D4 block above records what guessing them costs).
    # PREDICTION for 'shell-helper-motes-light' — the same in SOLARIZED, the only light palette.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-13: every sentence as predicted, in that order, with the join, the tier
    # sentence and the vendor-price note all present.
    #
    # FOUR THINGS THE PREDICTION DID NOT COVER, and two of them changed the code:
    #   (a) **TWO answers, not one.** West Commonlands comes second, also serving both goals,
    #       because the SHARED FIXTURE LOG has motes of its own in it and that zone has enough
    #       kills to clear `MoteHistory.MinKills`. That is the floors behaving exactly as
    #       designed — the floor is on the ZONE's kills, not the creature's, which is why a
    #       zone whose motes came off four Ghoul kills still qualifies — and it makes a better
    #       picture than the single row that was predicted: a ranked list with the staged zone
    #       on top.
    #   (b) **The cadence discount FIRES on the staged zone, and only because of (a).** Najena
    #       runs 44.0 kills an hour against a pooled 95.7, so the sentence is drawn and the
    #       weight is applied. With one mote zone there would have been no baseline and no
    #       clause at all — the same "never compare a place with itself" rule D4 photographed,
    #       visible here by accident.
    #   (c) **TWO WORDING DEFECTS, FOUND ONLY BY READING THE PICTURE** (trap 23). The first
    #       take read "Shadowed man gave you 8 motes of it (40 experience) across your 50 kills
    #       of it" — two pronouns pointing at different things and the first at nothing — and
    #       "Bone Chips drops here from Shadowed man — 3 of your 50 kills of it", where the 50
    #       belongs to the creature and reads as kills of the item. Every assertion passed on
    #       both. `HelperPresentation` was changed and both shots retaken.
    #   (d) The vendor-price note sits at the very bottom edge and its last line is cut at this
    #       window size — the same density observation D6 filed against its own gear shots, and
    #       it is filed in `BEVEL.md` rather than restyled here.

    # ---- E-3 lane S, S2: World's fifth tab -------------------------------------------
    #
    # Same illustration lock: a room's shot lands in the PR that lands the room, and this is
    # a tab ARRIVING in a room that already had four. Both use $DropsFixtureWiki, seeded at
    # the top of this file for the reason recorded there — a partial seed does not fail, it
    # sends the app to the live wiki and turns the capture into a picture of whatever
    # eqlwiki said that minute.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the shots (trap 23/51):
    #
    #   'shell-world-drops' — native chrome reading "EQBuddy — World", the rail of SIX in
    #     RailOrder with World lit. The room's wrapped strip is FIVE chips now —
    #     Map · Camps · Path · Travels · Drops — with DROPS lit and badged "13 creatures"
    #     (the fixture's creatures-with-loot: the same thirteen seeded above and the same
    #     number 'drops-window' shows). Map is badged with the fixture's zone; Camps and
    #     Path carry no badge, because a running timer count on a tab strip is a countdown
    #     by another name. Under it the Drops body exactly as 'drops-window' draws it: the
    #     filter box with Copy text / Copy CSV / Save CSV… beside it, the dim orientation
    #     footer ABOVE the rows (trap 37 — it carries the only in-app pointer to where the
    #     wiki pack went), then a heading per creature with its drop rows, each reading
    #     "wiki read just now" with a dim ↻ except Skeleton at "wiki read 5d ago" with a
    #     live one. Pinned BELOW the body, as on every other World tab: "Drop camp marker".
    #     **Two things that must NOT be there**: the deaths star and its "Show in mini
    #     dashboard" label, which stay with WorldWindow because that star is the only writer
    #     MiniStats has for "deaths" (trap 13/20); and any second title bar, since the room
    #     is a view in the shell's chrome rather than a window shrink-wrapped into one.
    #
    #   'shell-world-drops-narrow' — THE ONE THAT CAN DISPROVE SOMETHING, and the reason it
    #     is here rather than for illustration. Bevel's pre-design §5 named one real width
    #     risk before any of this was built: the filter/export bar is a four-column Grid —
    #     the filter as the STAR column, three auto-sized TEXT buttons — and
    #     DropsCardView's own remarks say it was "sized for a 560px window". MinRoomWidth is
    #     520. This is that row at the floor (520 + the 60-unit collapsed rail).
    #     Predicted: the rail is icons only, six glyphs and no words; the three buttons keep
    #     their full labels, because auto columns take what they ask for; the filter box
    #     absorbs the whole squeeze as the star column and stays wide enough to type in; and
    #     the creature headings and drop rows read without horizontal clipping.
    #     **The failure this can show is the star column collapsing to nothing** — three
    #     buttons crushed against a filter box with no width left. If it does, the fix is
    #     the BAR (wrap it, the way the Inventory bar already had to be) and NOT
    #     MinRoomWidth, which is ProgressWindow's shipped width and a measured floor rather
    #     than a fresh guess.
    #
    # OUTCOME, both taken 2026-09-05 and both matching, which is worth writing down
    # because the narrow one was taken to DISPROVE something and did not:
    #  * 946x633 / 566x473. Five chips on one wrapped row at both widths, Drops lit and
    #    badged "13 creatures"; Map badged "West Commonlands"; Camps, Path and Travels
    #    unbadged (the fixture has no deaths, so Travels has nothing to say either).
    #  * The freshness captions read "wiki just now" and Skeleton "wiki 5d ago" — the
    #    prediction said "wiki read just now", which is the surface's older wording. The
    #    behaviour predicted is what shipped; only my quotation of it was stale.
    #  * **THE WIDTH RISK IS CLOSED AND `MinRoomWidth` DOES NOT MOVE.** At the floor the
    #    three buttons keep their full labels, the filter box absorbs the whole squeeze
    #    as the star column and is still comfortably typable, and no creature heading or
    #    drop row clips horizontally. The bar "sized for a 560px window" survives 520
    #    because the only thing that had to give was the star column, which is what a
    #    star column is for.
    #  * Neither picture shows the deaths star or a second title bar — the two absences
    #    only a picture can confirm were deliberate.

    # the v1 WINDOW — which this PR does not retire, rename or reshape. Checked
    # docs/screenshots/ and grepped docs/ for 'shell-settings' first: nothing.
    #
    # The illustration lock: a room's shots land in the PR that lands the room, and these are
    # the four the rail can reach. Nothing here fetches the wiki, and every staged state is
    # settings-driven, so all four are shot offline.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the run (trap 23/51) — the SHAPE and only the literals the
    # staging actually pins:
    #
    #   All four — a native title bar reading "EQBuddy — Settings" (not "Options", and not a
    #     bare "EQBuddy": the room is in the title because that is the only thing that tells
    #     this window from the widget, trap 24 inside one process). The rail shows SEVEN rows
    #     with labels — Home · Live · Progress · Gear · Quests · World, then a VISIBLE GAP,
    #     then Settings, lit. That gap is the picture's own assertion: `BelowTheGap` has
    #     answered true for Settings since PR 1 and until now there was no room to see it
    #     with. A four-chip strip under the title: Look · Alerts · HUD · Behavior. **The
    #     third chip must read "HUD" and not "Cards & windows"** — the signed word (Bevel
    #     I-11 §3) landing structurally, and the one thing in these four pictures that a
    #     reader should check first.
    #
    #   'shell-settings-look' — Look lit, and NO second strip under the main one (the Alerts
    #     family sub-strip is collapsed on every other tab). Body: "Theme" over a combo
    #     reading the palette this run was shot in, then four labelled sliders with live
    #     percentages beside them, the alignment grid and its spacing, the cursor ring.
    #     **What must NOT be here is the sentence "Drag either side edge to widen this
    #     window"** — that is about `OptionsWindow`'s resize grips, a room does not have
    #     them, and SR-1 left it declared beside them in the window's own XAML for exactly
    #     this moment. Its absence is the only thing in this shot that can disprove that.
    #
    #   'shell-settings-alerts' — Alerts lit, and a SECOND strip appears under the first:
    #     Watch rules · Buffs · Spawns · Crowd control. Badges from `AlertSurface.Tabs()`
    #     with this profile's real counts, so: Watch rules "3" (the three rules staged
    #     below, the same three 'tracked-card' seeds), Buffs "0", Spawns "0" (TrackSpawns is
    #     off in every shot profile), and **Crowd control with NO badge at all** — null means
    #     "not applicable" where 0 means "none yet, and that is actionable", and a "0" beside
    #     a tab that configures a switch would read as failure rather than as a default.
    #     Body: the shared sound/voice/volume/rate header, THEN the Watch rules editor with
    #     three rows. The header is above the sub-strip's content and drawn once — Bevel §2's
    #     cross-cutting default, not one family's content — so a second copy of it inside the
    #     Watch block would be the thing this picture disproves.
    #     Both strips WRAP (trap 25): the second one carries badges, so its chip widths depend
    #     on content, and a horizontal StackPanel would clip "Crowd control" off the end with
    #     no ellipsis. If the fourth chip is missing, that is the bug, not the shot.
    #
    #   'shell-settings-hud' — HUD lit, no sub-strip. Body: "What EQBuddy shows" over the
    #     EIGHT panel rows the widget has since the two HUD cuts (Combat, Healing, Kills &
    #     Drops, Gear & Loot, Watch, Buffs, Progress, Motes), then "No longer on the widget"
    #     with the six retired names under it, then "Mini dashboard" and the floating-window
    #     list. **This is the same body 'options-cards' photographs, in a second host** —
    #     shot at 100% here rather than that shot's 0.55 zoom, because the shell window is
    #     tall enough not to need it. The two pictures side by side are the parity claim.
    #     RE-SHOT 2026-09-08 for the prose-to-hover pass. **Each of the three headings now
    #     carries an ⓘ and NO paragraph under it** — the panel-list, mini-dashboard and
    #     floating-window explanations are hovers, and this picture is the only thing that
    #     can say the affordance rendered at all. **The two long notes under the tick boxes
    #     are STILL PRINTED IN FULL** (XP/DPS/HPS, and pet damage's always-on row); they were
    #     deliberately not moved, and a picture missing them is the defect rather than the
    #     tidier screen it would look like.
    #
    #   'shell-settings-behavior' — Behavior lit, no sub-strip. Body: "EQBuddy Mobile (Beta)"
    #     and its button first (NOT buried at the bottom), the three hide-when rules with the
    #     Alt+Tab note, keep-above, the hotkey rows, the regen override, auto-empty +
    #     archive, the tutorial toggle and the perf readout. **The log-archive explanation
    #     appears ONCE** — the v1 tab declared it twice, one dim paragraph under a strict
    #     superset of itself, and SR-1 collapsed it for both hosts; a second copy here would
    #     mean the collapse did not travel.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-06, all four 946x633. Every prediction above held: the title, the seven-row
    # rail with the gap above Settings, the four chips with "HUD" third, the sub-strip on
    # Alerts alone with badges 3 / 0 / 0 / none, the sound header above the rules editor, the
    # eight panel rows, and no resize sentence on Look. Two amendments, both to the
    # PREDICTION rather than to the app:
    #
    #   * 'shell-settings-hud' — the retired list is TWO ROWS naming six surfaces ("Quests is
    #     now the Quest Tracker window — Sky Quest · Epics are tabs in it…", "World is now the
    #     World window — Travels & Deaths · Zone map · Travel route · Spawn timers are tabs in
    #     it…"), not six rows. The block was predicted as "the six retired names", which is
    #     what the LIST says and not what it is SHAPED like; `OverlaySections.Retired` is
    #     keyed by the cut, one row per cut. The dump agrees (`shellSettingsHudRetired=2`), so
    #     the number the E2E compares across the two hosts is rows, deliberately.
    #   * 'shell-settings-alerts' — **the shared header's sentence reads "While Options is
    #     open, the ★ alert banner tile is visible", on this host too, and that is the KNOWN
    #     divergence rather than a stale string.** `MainWindow.OnOptions` pairs
    #     `AlertTile.EnterPlacement()` with the v1 window's `Closed`; a room is navigated to
    #     and away from rather than opened and closed, so the room does not enter placement
    #     and the tile is not draggable while you are here. The sentence is true as written —
    #     it describes Options, which still exists and still works — and rehoming the drag
    #     target is a named blocker on the commit that retires `OptionsWindow`
    #     (`SettingsRoom.cs`, `SettingsRoomTests`, flagged to Bevel). If a later pass gives
    #     the shell a placement affordance, this sentence and this shot both change with it.
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-08 for the prose-to-hover PASS 2, which reaches the three tabs the HUD
    # pass did not. These windows are a fixed 946x633, so unlike 'options-*' there is no
    # height to read — the CONTENT is the whole evidence, and each clause below is written
    # before the capture. **This is also the parity claim in a second host**: every paragraph
    # named here left the v1 window in the same commit, and the two pictures side by side are
    # what says one block serves both.
    #
    #   * 'shell-settings-look' — the grid-overlay tick box carries an ⓘ at the end of its row
    #     and NO paragraph under it. Everything else on the tab is unchanged, INCLUDING the
    #     four short lines under the sliders and the cursor ring's two sentences: they are
    #     under the twenty-word ceiling and a picture missing one of them is the defect.
    #   * 'shell-settings-alerts' — an ⓘ on "Slow alert…" and on "Only during raids", with
    #     their two paragraphs gone. **The shared header's alert-banner sentence is STILL
    #     PRINTED** (the known divergence above still stands, and it is now also a Pass 2
    #     exemption: the banner tile has no control on this screen to hang an ⓘ beside).
    #     **So is the Watch block's opening paragraph** — the sub-strip lands on Watch rules,
    #     and that explanation stayed for the same reason: the block's only heading belongs to
    #     the host, so there is nothing inside it to hang on.
    #   * 'shell-settings-behavior' — EIGHT ⓘ, one more than the v1 window has, because this
    #     host is the one that draws the Setup row and its note moved too. Gone from the body:
    #     the two hide/keep-above explanations, the hotkeys paragraph (its ⓘ is on the
    #     HEADING), the regen override's, auto-empty's, the archive's, the CPU/memory one, and
    #     Setup's. **STILL PRINTED IN FULL: the Alt+Tab note, the "hide while the game isn't
    #     running" note, and EQBuddy Mobile's two lines** — each names a door or a default.
    #     The log-archive explanation still appears ONCE, on its ⓘ rather than twice.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-08, all three 946x633. Every clause above held, with ONE amendment to the
    # PREDICTION rather than to the app:
    #
    #   * 'shell-settings-behavior' — **"EIGHT ⓘ" is not a claim this picture can make.** The
    #     room is a fixed-height window that scrolls, and the tab ends below the fold: the
    #     shot reaches the regen row, so auto-empty, the archive, the tutorial toggle, the
    #     CPU/memory line and the Setup row are all off the bottom, along with four of the
    #     eight ⓘ. What it DOES show is the half that matters here — the four conversions and
    #     all three exemptions are above the fold together, which is the comparison. The
    #     eight-versus-seven claim is `ShellHostTests`' (`behaviorHints` minus
    #     `behaviorSetup`), and it was always going to be, because a scrolling room cannot
    #     photograph a count. The prediction should have said so; a picture asked for a number
    #     it cannot hold is trap 22's shape wearing an assertion.
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-23 for DRA-352 D2/D3 (Founder direction). PREDICTED BEFORE THE
    # CAPTURE — 'shell-settings-hud': the same body 'options-cards' now shows, in the room
    # (no retired block, no mini-dashboard notes or restore button, no Floating windows
    # list; the dump agrees - no `shellSettingsHudRetired`/`HudWindows` keys at all).
    # 'shell-settings-alerts': the shared header with NO alert-banner sentence (so the
    # "known divergence" amendment above is moot - the sentence is gone from both hosts)
    # and NO "Used wherever EQBuddy speaks" line; the Watch block below is unchanged.

    # The PROGRESS theme EXPANDED IN PLACE (Inline themes PR 1). Title is 'EQBuddy' — this
    # is the widget, not the window, which is the whole point of the change. A NEW name,
    # per trap 21: 'progress-card' and 'section-progress' are both embedded in the docs and
    # both still mean the old thing.
    #
    # It stages the same level-up 'progress-card' does, and for a second reason on top of
    # that one: the inline body is CAPPED (WidgetMetrics.ThemeBodyMaxHeight), and a room
    # shorter than its cap photographs as a card with no cap at all. A shot that cannot
    # reach the state under review reads as reviewed anyway (trap 22).
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the shot (trap 23): the Progress card is the ONLY expanded
    # one (the named EQBUDDY_EXPAND form opens just its key). Under its header, a four-chip
    # wrapped strip — Experience, Wealth, Faction, Raids — each carrying the badge the
    # window's strip carries. Experience is lit, being the room that moves while you play.
    # Below it the Experience body, now TALLER than the cap: the same lines 'progress-card'
    # shows (16 xp gains, Last 15m, 1 AA point, Next level, Level 12 at ...), then "New at
    # level 12" with Heroic Leap and Unbound Wrath, and it should CUT with a scrollbar
    # rather than run the widget off the screen. On the header, right of the summary and
    # left of the chevron, a ↗ that opens the window; the chevron itself reads DOWN.
    #
    # THE CUT DID NOT HAPPEN, and the prediction was wrong about the interesting half.
    # Everything above is what the picture shows EXCEPT the cap: the full body — through
    # "Double Riposte / Archetype · 3 ranks" — fits in about 175 units against a cap of
    # 320, with no scrollbar. Staging a level-up does not make this room tall; nothing in
    # the Progress theme is tall. That is the finding, not a fixture bug: the cap is a
    # guard for the themes with LISTS in them (PR 2's Loot rows and Drops), and the reason
    # to keep the append anyway is the "New at level 12" block, which is real content this
    # card has to draw and the shared fixture never produces.
    # SKILL-UPS staged since 1.99.15 (the fold, David's ask): the shared fixture never
    # produces a skill-up line, so before this append NO shot could show the heading at
    # all — the fold shipped into a surface no picture covered (trap 22), which the
    # release review closed. PREDICTION (trap 23), added before the re-shoot: between the
    # ding block and the AA lines, a "Skill-ups" heading with an open chevron and two
    # rows — "1H Slashing  112 (+1)" and "Dodge  55 (+1)" — because ShowSkillUps defaults
    # true; everything else identical to the previous capture.

    # ---- #250: the theme body's cap follows the height grip ----
    #
    # These two are the ACCEPTANCE for the 320-cap change, and 'theme-inline-loot' above is
    # their baseline: same card, same room, same fixture, undragged. The Loot room is the
    # one that overflows 320 on this fixture (the committed baseline shows 17 rows and a
    # scrollbar), which is what makes "more rows" a thing a picture can settle.
    #
    # NOT the Paineless Motes/SectionScroll image: that is #250's OWN track (Helm-signed
    # 2026-08-29) and using it here would be accepting one change with another's evidence.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the first run (trap 23 — a shot whose numbers you did not
    # predict in advance has not been reviewed):
    #
    #  theme-body-dragged (100%, ContentHeight 900)
    #    * The widget window is TALLER than the baseline's 851px — the drag is what does
    #      that, and it is the half Paineless could already see working.
    #    * The Loot body is capped near the CEILING rather than the floor: 900 units of
    #      granted stack minus the other cards' headers (eleven of them, plus this card's
    #      own header and its two chip strips) leaves comfortably more than 640, so the cap
    #      clamps to 640 — exactly 2x the baseline.
    #    * So the room shows MORE loot rows than the baseline's 17, and its scrollbar is
    #      shorter or gone. It must NOT show a different SET of rows: same order, same
    #      counts, same "×11 Bone Chips" at the top. A changed order would mean the shot is
    #      of a different state (trap 23), not of a taller body.
    #    * Every sibling card is still visible and still collapsed. The point of the cap is
    #      that one open card does not push the glance off the widget, and 640 with the
    #      stack at 900 leaves room for all of them.
    #
    #  theme-body-dragged-125 (125%, same drag)
    #    * FEWER body units than the 100% shot, not more — and this is the prediction most
    #      likely to be got wrong by intuition. ContentHeight is pre-scale, so a 900-unit
    #      drag on a work area of H screen pixels is granted min(900, (H-160)/1.25): on a
    #      1080p screen that is 736 units, and the cap lands under the ceiling rather than
    #      on it. Everything is DRAWN 1.25x larger, so the row count drops again.
    #    * It must still be well above the 320 floor. If this shot shows the same rows as
    #      the baseline, the monitor clamp is eating the whole drag and the pairing above
    #      is the thing to re-read — not the formula.
    #
    # WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, measured off the app's own dump on a 1032px work area, kept
    # beside the prediction rather than replacing it — a corrected prediction that erases
    # the miss teaches nobody anything:
    #
    #    100%   sectionCapScreen 872, granted 872, chrome 379, cap 493   (predicted 640)
    #    125%   sectionCapScreen 872, granted 698, chrome 379, cap 320   (the floor)
    #    auto   cap 320                                                  (predicted, exact)
    #
    #  * Every VISIBLE claim held: 925px vs 851px, 21 rows vs 17, the body scrollbar gone,
    #    same order and counts, every sibling card still on screen. The 640 was wrong for
    #    two reasons worth writing down. The drag never gets what it asked for — 900 is
    #    clamped to the 872-unit work area before the cap sees it — and the CHROME is far
    #    bigger than a card-count guess suggests: ten sibling headers plus this card's own
    #    header, two chip strips and its padding come to 379 units, nearly half the stack.
    #    **The ceiling is not the operative bound on a 1080p screen; the chrome is.**
    #  * The 125% shot landed on the branch the prediction named as its own falsifier: 698
    #    granted minus 379 chrome is 319, under the floor, so the floor holds and the
    #    picture is the baseline's 17 rows. That is CORRECT and not a defect — at 125% with
    #    ten cards showing, a 1032px screen has no room left to give, and the widget is
    #    already at its full height. It is also the honest limit of this change: #250's fix
    #    buys real room at 100% and nothing at 125% on a small screen. Raising the floor
    #    globally is the alternative, and the three-class lock forbids it.

    # THE UNLOCKS TAB'S GUIDED DETAIL (DRA-65, Founder ask: "each Unlock needs more guided
    # detail; filter between race and class unlocks").
    #
    # Trap 22 at its purest: this tab has NEVER had a shot, because it exists only in response
    # to two /outputfile dumps and with neither of them staged it is an empty state asking for
    # a command. Everything the guided pass adds — the mover sentences, the kills-to-go
    # estimate, the piece count, the four ↗ doors and the section chip strip that replaced the
    # ComboBox — is unreviewable without all three of the dumps, the faction dump and a live
    # session that actually moved a faction.
    #
    # Staged through the REAL seams, never a back door: the two dumps sit where the game writes
    # them (game/, the Logs folder's parent) and the movers are LOG LINES the app's own tail
    # parses into the per-creature faction ledger. Append-Log gives every appended line ONE
    # timestamp, which is what puts each faction line inside its kill's 3-second reward window
    # — the attribution the pool folds.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the shot (trap 23). Four rows, and each is a different arm:
    #   * Coalition of Tradesfolk — the dump spells it "Coalition of Tradefolk" (one letter,
    #     a real disagreement from Hateborne's own pair), so the row proves FactionNames is
    #     doing the fold: standing "1,000 / 2,000 — 1,000 to go", and THREE guided lines —
    #       "Your kills of an orc centurion in West Commonlands moved it +5 each — seen on 3
    #        of your kills."
    #       "Your kills of a Freeport merchant in West Commonlands cost you 10 each — seen on
    #        1 of your kills."
    #       "≈200 more kills of an orc centurion in West Commonlands at +5 each — an estimate
    #        from your own log, not a target."   (1,000 to go ÷ 5 = 200)
    #     West Commonlands because that is the fixture's LAST zone, and the pool is keyed on
    #     the kill zone; both creatures are absent from the fixture, so their counts are the
    #     appended ones and nothing else.
    #   * Knights of Truth — maxed in the dump, so "maxed" and NO estimate.
    #   * Freeport Militia — deliberately NOT in the faction dump, so the existing honesty line
    #     ("not in your faction dump — tell us and we will add the name") stands, with the wiki
    #     door beside it and no arithmetic.
    #   * Obtain Azure Ruby Ring (Warrior) — the Sky checklist's own count: sky-194 ticked and
    #     sky-195 not, so "1 of 2 pieces in hand — the Plane of Sky tab has the guide." and a
    #     ↗ onto the Plane of Sky tab.
    # So: 4 rows · 4 doors (three wiki, one Sky) · 4 guided sentences · the All | Races |
    # Classes chip strip in the filter row with All selected, and no ComboBox anywhere.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-11: the four rows, the four doors, the chip strip and every number above
    # came out exactly as predicted — and the prediction was WRONG in two places that only a
    # picture was going to catch, which is the whole argument for taking one.
    #
    #   1. KNIGHTS OF TRUTH DRAWS TWO MOVERS OF ITS OWN. The fixture log already carries
    #      sixteen "Your faction standing with Knights of Truth has been adjusted by 5" lines
    #      — I predicted "nothing was farmed for it" without grepping the log I was staging
    #      into, which is trap 23 from the other side: the staging was right and my model of
    #      the fixture was not. Two of the sixteen land inside a kill's 3-second reward
    #      window (Orc pawn, Skeleton, one hit each) and the rest are attributed to no kill.
    #      The row is BETTER for it, and it is the maxed rule photographed: nothing left to
    #      divide, so the estimate goes and what your kills DID stays. Six guided sentences
    #      on screen, not four.
    #   2. THE CREATURE NAMES ARE THE PARSER'S, NOT THE LOG'S. "You have slain an orc
    #      centurion!" is pooled as "Orc centurion" — LogParser normalises the article away
    #      and title-cases — so the sentence reads "Your kills of Orc centurion in West
    #      Commonlands", not "of an orc centurion". Worth knowing before anyone predicts one
    #      of these strings again; the unit tests assert the format, and this is where the
    #      real feed's spelling shows up.

    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-13, and 'quest-unlocks' above is a REGRESSION PICTURE of this slice —
    # its rows changed without its staging changing, which is exactly the shot the
    # illustration lock exists to keep honest.
    #
    # PREDICTION for the re-shot 'quest-unlocks', written before the run:
    #   * A NEW BUTTON in the filter row, beside the All | Races | Classes chips, reading
    #     "Any unlock" — nothing is picked, and the face says what the off-state means.
    #   * Coalition of Tradesfolk: the six guided lines become a dim POINTER line reading
    #     "Orc centurion · West Commonlands" and ONE visible sentence, the estimate
    #     ("≈200 more kills of Orc centurion in West Commonlands at +5 each…"). The two
    #     mover sentences are on the row's HOVER and are not in the picture — a tooltip is
    #     its own top-level window and PrintWindow does not composite one (trap 79's
    #     neighbour). Stated rather than staged: 'shell-helper-unlocks' below is where the
    #     new control is photographed, and the movers' own wording is asserted in
    #     UnlockGuidanceTests.
    #   * Knights of Truth: a pointer line and NO sentence under it. It is maxed, so there
    #     is nothing left to divide and no estimate — the one row in the picture that shows
    #     what P12 does to a row whose evidence is all prose.
    #   * Freeport Militia: unchanged and still silent. Not in the faction dump, so no
    #     mover, no pointer, no hover — absence of evidence stays silence (trap 73).
    #   * Obtain Azure Ruby Ring: unchanged. "1 of 2 pieces in hand" is a QUANTITY and stays
    #     on the row; the Sky shape has no creature and so draws no pointer.
    #
    # 'quest-unlocks-picked' — the SAME tab with a pick made. A second race is added to the
    # dump for this shot only, because a filter with one row to filter cannot be seen doing
    # anything: the pick names Human (Freeport), so Barbarian is hidden and the tab SAYS so.
    #
    # PREDICTION: the face reads "Human (Freeport)" (one pick is always named, never
    # counted); the Races section draws Human (Freeport) alone with the note "1 more unlock
    # is hidden by your pick. Untick them all to see every one." above it; and the CLASSES
    # section is untouched — Warrior is still there, with no note over it, because the pick
    # names nothing in that section. That last one is the whole argument for one flat list
    # of subject names, and it is the half a screenshot can actually show.
    # SHOT 2026-09-13: every prediction above came out as written, on both pictures — the
    # "Any unlock" face in the filter row, the two pointer lines, Knights of Truth's pointer
    # with no sentence under it, Freeport Militia still silent, the piece count still on the
    # row, the hidden note over a Races section of one, and the Classes section untouched.
    #
    # TWO THINGS THE PREDICTION DID NOT NAME, both correct and both worth knowing:
    #   1. The TAB BADGE on 'quest-unlocks-picked' reads "Unlocks 0 / 3" — all three, not the
    #      one in view. That is right: the badge is progress and the pick is a view, and a
    #      badge that moved when you filtered would be the window telling you that you had
    #      un-unlocked something.
    #   2. Knights of Truth's top raiser is "Orc pawn", not the Orc centurion the sibling row
    #      names. The 2026-09-11 note above recorded that the FIXTURE already carries sixteen
    #      Knights of Truth lines and that two of them land inside a kill's reward window;
    #      the pointer is naming the better of those two. The row is the picture's best
    #      argument for P12 — maxed, nothing to divide, and what your kills DID is one hover
    #      away instead of two sentences wide.

    # rows are locked and LOOK locked" (its rows on screen). A guided class is one tall
    # group where the classic tab drew short sections, so expanding the complete class now
    # pushes the other class's band off the bottom of a window with no size hook. Keeping
    # one frame would have meant a picture that no longer shows what the recipe says it

    #   PREDICTED before the re-shoot (trap 23):
    #   * A "Cleric" band with a "Reopen" button — the complete state of the master check.
    #   * ONE heading where the classic tab drew one per section: "Cleric · Epic 1.0  0/20",
    #     and under it the NEXT card and the stage heading "Cleric Epic Quest" (the page has
    #     no sub-headings, so the run is named for the quest rather than "Checklist").
    #   * Its rows DIMMED and unclickable, each one's hover saying Cleric's epic is marked
    #     complete. Dimmed and not merely disabled: the CheckBox style carries no disabled
    #     visual, so IsEnabled alone reads as live and silently ignores clicks (trap 17).
    #   * The flag is written DIRECTLY, so Cleric reads "complete" at 0/20 — a state the
    #     app itself never produces, because the real MarkComplete ticks every row on its
    #     way in. It is here to photograph the locked rows; do not read the count as

    #   complete" over "Warrior · Epic 1.0  0/30". Alphabetical, so Cleric leads. That is

    #   offer, "Reopen" above it is the completed one. The green did not move (per the

    # PREDICTION, rewritten BEFORE the re-shoot (trap 23), for Surface A / SA-1 and

    # than a pre-promotion profile being migrated under the shot: `HudStatStarsRestored`
    # stands the restore pass down, so what is seeded is what draws. 'hps' is deliberately
    # not among them — see the note above `mini-bar`. So expect, left to right:
    #   * the METRIC ROW first: the character name slot ("Testchar"), a Swords + dps
    #     reading, and a Chart + %/hr reading. Three slots, because two of the three
    #     metric ★s are set and 'hps' is not.
    #   * then SEVEN starred cells in MiniBarPresentation.Order: kills, pet, procs, loot,
    #     motes, money, deaths. dps and xp are NOT among them — they draw up on the row,
    #     and a duplicate of either is the bug this prediction exists to catch.
    #   * hairline dividers between all ten, none after the last.
    # The three metric slots are FIXED WIDTH (HudGlance), so the bar's width must not
    # change between takes of the same seed — a wobble there is trap 12 arriving.
    #
    # AMENDED FOR DRA-72, and it is a WIDTH amendment: the XP slot's reserved box went from
    # 66 to 76 (the '%' and '/' out-measure a rate string's leading spaces, and a four-digit
    # rate was trimming), so this row is ten units wider than the same row on the old build.
    # **The PNG's total width is NOT a clean measure of that**, which is worth saying out
    # loud before somebody subtracts two numbers: three of this bar's cells re-derive from
    # the fixture's own elapsed time on every take (procs "N.N/min", motes "N · N.N/hr",
    # coin), so 907x40 on 2026-09-07 and 889x40 today differ by the CELLS as well. The shot
    # that isolates the slot is `mini-bar-chips` — its four cells are plain counts, and it
    # moved 628 -> 638, exactly the ten.
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-13, 889x40: every element of the OE-7 prediction below held — Testchar,
    # 13 dps, 14.5%/hr, then kills/pet/procs/loot/motes/money/deaths, DPS + XP%/hr + PET +
    # LOOT bordered, no divider after the last, no duplicate of any promoted number. There is
    # no hps slot here and that is the point of the pair. Until DRA-81 that was because the
    # fixture is melee and the slot decided for itself; it is now because this seed does not
    # star 'hps'. Same picture, and the reason it is the right picture is stronger — it is a
    # choice a player could make rather than a state the staging had to avoid. See
    # `mini-bar-healing` for the row that carries one.
    #
    # AMENDED FOR OE-7, and the last line above is the one that moved: **the divider is no
    # longer between all ten.** Every cell whose stat owns a floating window is an expansion
    # chip now — button chrome, no divider — because the ✕ on a float stopped writing
    # `DisabledBreakouts` and the chip is the only way back. So expect DPS, XP%/hr, PET and
    # LOOT bordered, and KILLS, PROCS, MOTES, MONEY and DEATHS as plain cells with hairline
    # dividers, none after the last. Re-shot 2026-09-07 at 907x40 and every element held,
    # including the width: the trio is still fixed-width, and a chip's border adds no
    # measured jitter because it is a constant.
    #
    # AMENDED FOR DRA-81 (the Founder LOCK), and the amendment is one dropped key: 'hps'
    # left this seed. Every slot on the metric row is a ★ now — nothing is "always on" and
    # nothing arrives from the log — so a seeded 'hps' would have drawn an HPS slot reading
    # "0 hps" here, and this shot and `mini-bar-healing` would have become two PNGs of one
    # picture differing only in a number. **A seeded MiniStats IS the row now**, which is
    # why 'dps' and 'xp' had to be stated in every bar shot below that had been relying on
    # them being unswitchable. Nothing about the committed PNGs changed: the row is the same

    #
    # **WHAT MAKES THE PAIR SINCE DRA-81 IS THE ★, NOT THE LOG.** Under DRA-72 these two
    # differed by three heals: the slot ARRIVED when healing out-weighed damage across a
    # ~30 s window, so the only way to photograph it was to stage the session. The Founder
    # LOCK deleted that rule — the slot is here because 'hps' is in this seed and for no
    # other reason — so the difference between the two PNGs is now exactly the difference
    # between the two tick boxes, which is the thing a reader is being shown.
    #
    # The heals STAY, and they are no longer staging the slot's membership: they are what
    # puts a real number in it. `Add-LogLines` stamps every appended line with ONE
    # timestamp. Without them this shot would be `mini-bar` plus "0 hps" — a correct
    # picture of the feature and a poor illustration of it.
    #
    # **The two shots are a PAIR**: one row narrower, one row wider, one key apart. A single
    # shot of the wide row would prove the slot draws and say nothing about what it cost the
    # bar's width, which is the half trap 12 is about — and since DRA-81 the pair also shows
    # the only thing that can ever change that width, which is the player ticking a box.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the capture (trap 23). The metric row reads name
    # ("Testchar") · Swords + "N dps" · **Heal + "N hps"** · Chart + "N.N%/hr" — FOUR slots
    # where `mini-bar` has three. `HudGlancePet` is unset here exactly as it is there, so the
    # pet chip is still a starred CELL and the seven cells that follow are the same seven in
    # the same order. So this PNG is WIDER than `mini-bar.png` by one metric slot plus its
    # gap, and that difference IS the acceptance criterion; every other element must be
    # identical. The hps reading will be small — the denominator is the fixture's whole
    # session of combat seconds and the three heals are one moment — and a small number is
    # the correct picture rather than a staging failure: the SLOT is what this shot is about.

    # SHOT 2026-09-13, 991x40, and the prediction held in every element: Testchar · Swords
    # "13 dps" · **Heal "34 hps"** · Chart "14.2%/hr", then the same seven cells in the same
    # order (82 kills, 1.6 dps pet, 0/min procs, 39 loot, "1 · 0.9/hr" motes, 5p 1g 4s 8c,
    # 0 deaths) and the ↗ / ✕. 991 against `mini-bar`'s 889 is one metric slot plus its gap.
    # The hps reading is a real number rather than the near-zero the prediction allowed for —
    # the three heals are large and the denominator is combat seconds, not wall time.
    # THE UNDER-BAR PANEL (OE-1). Its own window, so it is shot by its own title: the bar
    # ABOVE it is `mini-bar`'s picture and the two are separate windows on purpose — a panel
    # drawn inside the widget would resize a SizeToContent always-on-top window on a hover,
    # which is trap 12 / #173's exact mechanism.
    #
    # **Only the two TARGETS are shot, not the four MODES.** A peek and a pin render the
    # identical panel — that is what makes lock 4 a state rather than a look — so a
    # `hud-expand-peek` beside a `hud-expand-pinned` would be two committed PNGs of one
    # picture, which is worse than none: it reads as coverage of a distinction neither can
    # see. The mode is asserted from the dump instead (`hudExpandMode`, HudExpandTests).

    # PREDICTION, written before the shot (trap 23):
    #   * `hud-expand-dps` — a rounded panel with a hairline edge: Swords vector, "Your
    #     damage", ⧉ and ✕ on the header row; a dim "Session · Nm in combat · N dps"
    #     subtext; then up to FIVE damage bar rows off the melee fixture, each "total ·
    #     rate dps", and a dim "…and N more — ⧉ for the full list" if the session has more
    #     than five sources.
    #   * `hud-expand-progress` — a Chart vector, "Progress", and the Progress LAUNCHER
    #     line as the subtext (xp %, coin, motes/hr where there are motes); then the
    #     Experience room's own summary lines. Not bar rows: the glance, because the ⧉ here
    #     opens the Progress WINDOW and rebuilding its rooms in a panel is the tab-less
    #     float the 2026-08-25 fold retired.
    # A panel that is all empty-state text on either shot is a staging bug until proven
    # otherwise, not a feature — the fixture has both damage and experience in it.

    # **Pet has NO shot on purpose.** Its rows come from `LivePresentation.Meter`, the same

    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the first run (trap 23):
    #   * `hud-expand-loot` — Bag vector, "Loot", ↗ and ✕; subtext "Session · 39 items ·
    #     15 kinds" off the melee fixture; FIVE bar rows, most-picked-up first, each value a
    #     bare count with the gauge a share of the biggest; then "…and 10 more — ↗ for the
    #     full list". It is the UNCONFIGURED top slice on purpose: the float carries the view
    #     and sort strips (lock 6), and a peek with a second axis the player can see but not
    #     change would be a state with no switch.
    #   * `hud-expand-watch` — Target vector, "Watch list"; the same three seeded rules as
    #     `watch-solo`, all of which the fixture matches, so "Session · 3 pinned rules ·
    #     N total" and THREE rows with "count · N.N/hr", no overflow line. `TrackedRules` is
    #     seeded and `DefaultRulesVersion` pinned for the reason `HudBarTests` gives: the
    #     built-ins ship PINNED, so letting them apply would make the row count track however
    #     many the current version happens to carry rather than what this shot is about.
    #   * `hud-expand-buffs` — Timer vector, "Buff set"; subtext "8 buffs up"; FIVE rows,
    #     SOONEST TO FADE FIRST, which is the opposite order to every other panel here (the
    #     rest are biggest-first, and the urgent buff is the one with the least left). Off
    #     `buffs-card`'s own eight-buff staging that means Insight, Brilliance, Spirit of Ox,
    #     Symbol of Pinzarn, Valor — each face a countdown with " est", each gauge nearly
    #     FULL because these have just landed and the gauge draws what is LEFT — then
    #     "…and 3 more — ↗ for the full list".
    # A panel that is all empty-state text on any of the three is a staging bug until proven
    # otherwise: the fixture has loot, the rules match it, and the appended lines land buffs.
    #
    # The panel is ONE fixed width (300) as of OE-7, so all five `hud-expand-*` shots must
    # come back the same width. A difference between them is trap 12 arriving — the buff
    # countdown is what forced the fixed width, since a content-driven one would resize an
    # always-on-top window once a second.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-07. All five came back 300 wide, which is the fixed-width claim holding.
    #   * `hud-expand-loot` 300x201 — every element of the prediction held, numbers included:
    #     "Session · 39 items · 15 kinds", Bone Chips 11 / Spider Silk 8 / Spider Legs 4 /
    #     Ruined Cat Pelt 3 / Chunk of Meat 2, then "…and 10 more — ↗ for the full list".
    #   * `hud-expand-watch` 300x133 — "Session · 3 pinned rules · 30 total" and exactly the
    #     three seeded rules, biggest first, each "N.N/hr  count". No overflow line, as
    #     predicted, because three rules cannot reach the five-row cap.
    #   * `hud-expand-buffs` 300x201 — "8 buffs up", five rows, " est" on every face, gauges
    #     nearly full, "…and 3 more". **The ORDER was mispredicted and the code is right:**
    #     the five are Brilliance and Insight (both 39:52), Spirit of Ox and Symbol of Pinzarn
    #     (both 44:52), then Health (53:52) — Valor is in the "3 more" because it ties Health
    #     at 53:52 and loses the alphabetical tiebreak. The prediction listed Valor fifth off
    #     the per-buff durations quoted in `buffs-card`'s own comment, which are that shot's
    #     PREDICTION rather than what it captured; its recorded result already says the first
    #     clock came back 39:51 instead. **A prediction copied from another prediction is not
    #     a prediction** — read the result line, not the expectation above it.
    # `hud-expand-dps` and `-progress` were re-shot in the same pass (300x201 and 300x132)
    # because the fixed width changes them: both were previously content-sized inside the old
    # 260–340 band. Contents unchanged.

    # ============================ OE-9: THE REST OF THE TRAY ==========================
    # `HudExpandTarget` went from seven members to eleven — the signed #389 plan's
    # four-target carve of the minimized bar. Four surfaces that nothing else in this file
    # photographs, so four shots (trap 22: a surface with no fixture state cannot be
    # reviewed and reads as reviewed anyway).
    #
    # **THERE IS NO `hud-expand-deaths` ROW, AND ITS PNG IS GONE WITH IT.** A Deaths target,
    # peek and shot were built, shot and then stripped on Helm's 2026-09-07 sign of #400 —
    # the Deaths gate, "#389 Deaths OUT stands". A recipe for a surface that no longer
    # exists stops the batch at that row under `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` (trap 53),
    # and a committed capture with no recipe is exactly what the illustration lock forbids,
    # so both halves left together. The deaths CELL still draws on the bar; `mini-bar` and
    # `world-travels` are where it and its star are photographed.
    #
    # **`hud-expand-procs` is STAGED rather than inherited, because the fixture has none.** A
    # `grep` for "feels alive with power" (the item-proc line `ItemProcRx` matches) comes
    # back ZERO — so left alone it would be one more picture of the empty-state layout
    # `hud-expand-watch` already covers, which is the reviewable half missing exactly where
    # the new code is. `AppendLive` supplies the lines.
    #
    # PREDICTIONS, written before the first run (trap 23) — each number grepped out of the
    # fixture rather than assumed:
    #   * `hud-expand-kills` — Skull vector, "Kills"; subtext "Session · 82 kills · N.N/hr"
    #     (the mini bar's own Kills cell reads 82 in `mini-bar-chips`' recorded result, so
    #     this is a cross-check as well as a prediction); FIVE bar rows, biggest first, each
    #     value a bare count, then "…and N more — ↗ for the full list".
    #   * `hud-expand-money` — Coin vector, "Coin"; subtext "Session · <coin> · <coin>/hr";
    #     FOUR rows and no fifth — Looted / Sold to vendors / Total / Per hour — with NO
    #     gauge on any of them, because this is one figure broken into its parts rather than
    #     a ranking. There is coin: thirty "You receive N silver … from the corpse" lines.
    #   * `hud-expand-motes` — Sparkle vector, "Motes"; ONE row, "Mote of Infinitesimal
    #     Potential", because the fixture carries exactly one mote line. Its gauge is full
    #     (it is the only tier) and the subtext carries #154's potency/hr.
    #   * `hud-expand-procs` — Bolt vector, "Weapon procs"; ONE row for the staged
    #     "Polished Mithril Mask (Exaltation)" proc, "×1 · N/min · 0 dmg" — zero damage
    #     because the staged line has no damage line behind it, which is a true state and
    #     the honest thing to photograph rather than faking a hit.
    # A panel that is all empty-state text on any of the four is a staging bug until proven
    # otherwise.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-07. All came back 300 wide, which is the fixed-width claim still holding
    # at eleven targets. Three predictions held exactly and TWO STAGINGS WERE WRONG, which
    # is the whole return on writing them down:
    #   * `hud-expand-kills` 300x201 — held. "Session · 82 kills · 74.6/hr"; Puma 21, Orc
    #     pawn 17, Giant spider 15, Skeleton 10, Asp 5; "…and 8 more — ↗ for the full list".
    #     The 82 cross-checks `mini-bar-chips`' own recorded Kills cell.
    #   * `hud-expand-money` 300x137 — held, including the no-gauge call: "Session · 5p 1g 4s
    #     8c · 4p 6g 8s 3c/hr" over Looted 1p 3g 4s 1c / Sold to vendors 3p 8g 7c / Total /
    #     Per hour, four rows and no fifth.
    #   * `hud-expand-motes` 300x89 — held. One row, full gauge, "Session · 1 · 0.9/hr · 0.9
    #     potency/hr".
    #   * `hud-expand-procs` — **WRONG TWICE, and both were staging.** (1) The proc line alone
    #     gave "0 procs · 0/min · 0 dmg": it only NAMES the vehicle, and a proc is recorded
    #     when spell damage arrives whose spell was never cast. (2) Adding a bare "points of
    #     non-melee damage" line gave the same empty panel: that parses with the source
    #     "Direct spell", which the proc rule explicitly excludes. The named-spell form works
    #     — 300x89, "Session · 1 proc · 0.1/min · 42 dmg", one row. **Both times the panel was
    #     a correct picture of a real state** (trap 23's second half), which is exactly how a
    #     wrong fixture reads as a working feature.
    #     → AND THE PICTURE FOUND SOMETHING NO TEST COULD: the row came back
    #     "Exaltation Strike · Polished Mithril…" over "0.1/min · 42 d…". A proc's name is
    #     "<spell> · <item>" whenever an item line named the vehicle, and that plus three
    #     facts does not fit 300 (trap 14's family). The rows now carry the untruncated line
    #     as a HOVER; the ↗ to the Damage float's procs block is the real answer.
    #   * `hud-expand-loot` — **also wrong, and the fix is the interesting one.** Left
    #     unstaged it came back byte-identical to `hud-expand-loot-notarget`: the fixture's
    #     trailing lines are past `TargetLinger` (45s from the log's last event), so the
    #     session ends with NO target and two shots photographed one state. With a /consider
    #     staged it is 300x161 — "Giant spider — 15 kills this session · drops (eqlwiki ·
    #     LIVE)" over Spider Silk 5 / Spider Legs 4 / Spider Venom Sac 2 (your observations,
    #     with percentages) and then "A Spider Venom Sac 22.8%" from the wiki. That last row
    #     is a DUPLICATE of the third under a leading article, which is `TargetDropsContent`'s
    #     own de-duplication and predates OE-9 — the Loot card and the float have always shown
    #     it. Filed for Bevel rather than fixed here.
    #   * `hud-expand-loot-notarget` 300x89 — held exactly: "No target" and the one dim line.
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-07 (`hud-expand-money` only, the owner's ~4:32 PM CT shot). THE
    # NO-GAUGE CALL RECORDED ABOVE WAS WRONG, and the committed picture is what said so:
    # `BreakdownRows.Row` floors a bar at 1%, so "no gauge" did not render as nothing — it
    # rendered as four identical stubs under four rows that plainly are parts of one figure.
    # The shares draw now. PREDICTION, written before the run and off the numbers this shot
    # already recorded (1p 3g 4s 1c + 3p 8g 7c = 5p 1g 4s 8c, which is 1341 + 3807 = 5148
    # copper — Core's own `Copper = CorpseCopper + VendorCopper`):
    #   * Still 300 wide and the same height — the bar row was always drawn, so nothing about
    #     the layout moves. A different height is a finding, not a detail.
    #   * Looted ~26% of the track, Sold to vendors ~74%, and the two together filling the
    #     width of Total's FULL bar directly under them. Per hour keeps the 1% stub, which is
    #     the one row where "no gauge" is the honest answer — worth LOOKING at, because that
    #     stub is what the owner reported and it has to read as deliberate beside three real
    #     bars rather than as the same bug on one row.
    #   * Every value string unchanged: the percentage is in the HOVER, not in the row (300
    #     wide, and `hud-expand-procs` above is what a coin string plus a percentage would do).
    # RESULT: held, and MEASURED rather than eyeballed — a bar's width is arithmetic, so a
    # look is not the check (trap 41's lesson at a smaller size). 300x159, values unchanged.
    # Against a full track of 279px: Looted 72px (25.8% vs the predicted 26.05%), Sold 206px
    # (73.8% vs 73.95%), Total the full 279, Per hour a 2px stub at the left edge — the 1%
    # floor, which is the row where "no gauge" is the honest answer. Beside three real bars
    # it reads as an absence rather than as a fourth bar that failed; that was the thing to
    # look at and it is the reason the row carries a tooltip saying so.
    # TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE RECORD ABOVE, neither about this change:
    #   * The "300x137" recorded for this shot on 2026-09-07 was never true — the committed
    #     PNG it describes is 300x159, and so is this one. The prediction was written against
    #     that number and the height did not move.
    #   * The old picture is ParchmentBrass and this one is Turquoise, because TR-1 (#399)
    #     moved this script's `-Theme` default at ~3:59 PM CT for the Helm OWNER LOCK of
    #     ~3:45 PM CT — teal + grey for Evolved captures. No palette NAMED "teal + grey"
    #     exists in `ThemePalettes`, so the lock is being served by the closest shipped one.
    #     The palette change is the lock arriving, not this change's doing; the other ten
    #     `hud-expand-*` shots are still pre-lock and will re-shoot into it when they are
    #     next touched.

    #
    # PREDICTION, written before the first run (trap 23): left to right, the always-on trio
    # (Testchar, a Swords + dps reading, a Chart + %/hr reading), then Kills, then Pet, then
    # Loot, then the buff set's own cell reading 8. **Every cell except the name and Kills
    # wears BUTTON CHROME now** — a rounded hairline border, no divider beside it — because
    # every one of them owns a floating window and is therefore an expansion chip; Kills has
    # no window, so it keeps its hairline divider and no border. That mix is the picture this
    # shot exists to check: it is the only place the two chip shapes appear side by side, and
    # nothing in a diff, a test or a build can say whether the bar reads as one row or as two
    # kinds of thing jostling.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-09-07, 635x40. Every element held: Testchar · 13 dps · 14.2%/hr · 💀 82 ·
    # 🐾 1.6 dps · 🎒 39 · ⏱ 8, with borders on the four windowed cells and a divider only
    # after Kills. **Reviewed at 2× first and then re-shot at 100%**, because at 100% the
    # hairline border is a single dim pixel and the two shapes were genuinely not tellable
    # apart in the capture — which is the reading a reviewer would also get, and the reason
    # it is worth saying here rather than leaving the next person to squint. The mix reads as
    # one row; the borders group without shouting.
    #
    # **OE-9 RETIRES THE MIX, so both paragraphs above are the record of what the committed
    # image shows rather than a live prediction.** Every cell on the bar is an expansion chip
    # now (the owner's ~1:29 PM CT amend), so there is no un-bordered cell left for Kills to
    # be: NEW PREDICTION is the name slot, then six bordered chips and NO hairline divider
    # anywhere. That is a real question for this shot rather than a formality — the reason
    # the old mix was worth photographing was that two shapes might jostle, and the reason
    # this one is, is that six borders in a row might read as a toolbar. It needs re-shooting
    # and LOOKING at, not just re-running.
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-13 for DRA-72, 628x40 -> 638x40 — and this shot is the one that MEASURES
    # that change rather than merely containing it: its four cells are plain counts (kills 82,
    # pet 1.6 dps, loot 39, buffs 8), so nothing here re-derives from elapsed time. **The ten
    # units were then proved rather than attributed**: the same seed shot against a build with
    # `ExperienceReservedWidth` put back to 66 came out at 628 — the committed width to the
    # pixel — so the difference is that constant and nothing else on the bar. Looked at: name, dps,
    # 14.2%/hr, then the four chips; six borders in a row still read as chips rather than as a
    # toolbar, so the open question above is answered again in the same direction.

    #     UNRECOGNIZED = 1.
    # No Conqueror section, so RaidsMarked = 0 and the two seeded clears are untouched.

    #    matched nothing on the checklist — Import achievements names it."
    # and an Undo button beneath it, because one reward really was written.
    #
    # SHOT 2026-08-22: all three counts as predicted. The FIRST take also proved its own
    # worth on the copy rather than the code — it read "1 obtained reward … names them",
    # because the plural was baked into the string. Nothing but a picture was ever going to
    # catch that; the unit test asserted the same wrong sentence quite happily.
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-08-23 after Bevel's ruling (Helm-signed): the three sentences became ONE
    # counted line — "1 Sky reward marked · 2 skipped · 1 unmatched" — with the reasons on
    # hover. Predicted and confirmed. Expect a SCROLLBAR now and the footer (provenance note
    # + ⧉ copy) below the fold: 21 boss rows plus a report exceed the card's height cap, so
    # the scroller is correct rather than a regression. What matters is what holds the TOP,
    # and that is the report and its Undo (trap 44). A tooltip cannot be photographed, so
    # the hover half is asserted in OutputfileAutoImportTests, not here.

    # The collapsed HUD as the quick tour's page describes it — the few stats you picked,
    # plus watch-rule chips — rather than as mini-bar shoots it, which is every cell up so
    # all the icons can be reviewed at once. Two stats and two PINNED rules: pinning is
    # what puts a rule on the bar, so without it the chips the sentence promises are absent
    # and the picture quietly contradicts the words beside it.
    #
    # PREDICTION, rewritten before the re-shoot (SA-1): the always-on trio (name, dps,
    # %/hr), then TWO starred cells — kills and loot — because the seed's third key, dps,
    # is now the trio's own second slot and the migration strips it. Then the two watch
    # chips, Motes and Ghouls. Seven cells; a bar with a dps reading TWICE on it is the
    # failure this names in advance.
    #
    # THE PINS ARE SEEDED EXPLICITLY, and they had to be. This shot's chips were once being
    # produced by a BUG, not by its staging: `Write-Settings` sets `WatchPinsMigrated`,
    # so `WatchPinMigration` skips and `PinWatchChips` stays at its default false — but
    # until 2026-08-31 the "any per-rule pin turns on the group pin" line sat ABOVE that
    # gate and ran every launch, which is #253 (HiramDucky) itself. `9b7f4daf` moved it
    # inside the gate, and from that day this shot's two chips were gone and nobody
    # noticed, because the committed PNG was last taken on 2026-08-24. Trap 22 exactly:
    # a surface with no fixture state photographs as an unremarkable bar, and the
    # sentence beside it in the tour goes on promising chips.
    #
    # `PinWatchChips = $true` left this staging in Surface A / SA-R: the master retired and
    # the per-rule 📌 below is the whole switch, so the two `Pinned = $true` lines are now the
    # entire reason the two chips are on the bar. The PREDICTION is unchanged at seven cells —
    # which is the point, because that master was ON here.
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-05, 705x40: BYTE-IDENTICAL to the committed PNG (md5 725584fc…), which
    # is the finding rather than a formality. Seven cells exactly as predicted — Testchar,
    # 13 dps, 14.5%/hr, then 82 (kills) and 39 (loot), then "Motes 1" and "Ghouls 2" — with
    # dps read ONCE. The two chips now reach the bar through the 📌 alone, and the picture
    # cannot tell, which is what the retirement promised players.
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-13 for DRA-72, 691x40 -> 686x40: seven cells exactly as predicted
    # (Testchar, 13 dps, 14.5%/hr, 82, 39, "Motes 1", "Ghouls 2"). **The width moved DOWN by
    # five while the XP slot gained ten, and the shortfall is not this change's**: the same
    # seed shot against a build with `ExperienceReservedWidth` back at 66 comes out at 676,
    # so the committed 691 was FIFTEEN units stale — some earlier change moved this bar and
    # nobody re-ran the shot. Trap 18's neighbour: a committed PNG is evidence about the build
    # that took it, and that build is not on `main` any more. This take repairs it.

    # RE-SHOT 2026-08-23 for two changes: the summary block grew a motes line, and the

    # fixture infers WARRIOR (its ding at 12 is Heroic Leap + Unbound Wrath, both Warrior
    # Class AAs, which is what 'dingRows=2' has always been). From there:

    # of its own.
    #
    # Trap 22 applies as hard as it does to 'history-window': the whole point of this
    # surface is that it survives a session roll, and a single live fixture session can
    # only ever show what the summary line above it already showed. So the store is primed
    # with THREE finished sessions, each shifted to its own day and carrying its own ding.

    # before. 'history-charts' primes as 'Aludra' because its charts take a character
    # FILTER; this surface takes the archiver's identity and compares it with SQL `=`, so

    # the state reads as reviewed anyway (trap 22).
    #
    # NO LEVEL-UP APPEND, and that is the second version of this shot. The first announced
    # level 12 the way 'progress-card' does, which added a six-row ding list above the
    # preview and pushed the THIRD group under the inline body's 320-unit cap -- so the
    # committed picture ended at Expulse Summoned with no Monk in it, while the prediction
    # below said the two empty groups were the point (found by Fable 5, v1.99.6 review;
    # trap 44 -- the shot fitted once). The level is seeded on the LEDGER instead: the

    # combination) and ledger level 12, with nothing appended to the log:
    #   - NO "New at level 12" block at all -- nothing dinged this session, and the ding
    #     list is what just happened rather than what is remembered.

    #     loots exactly one Mote of Infinitesimal Potential, line 1388).
    #   - the preview reads "At level 13: 3 new spells" -- 13 rather than 15, because with
    #     Druid in the list the next level with anything is the Druid spell tier.
    #   - under it, THREE groups in the ledger's own order: a chevron-less "Warrior" over
    #     "Nothing new at 13", an OPEN "Druid" holding Befriend Animal, Expulse Summoned
    #     and See Invisible (each "Druid spell"), and a chevron-less "Monk" over "Nothing
    #     new at 13". Druid opens because it is the first group with anything in it.
    #   - and no scrollbar on the Progress body.

    # deletes, and on screen their absence is indistinguishable from those classes not

    # Chicklets are separated by 3 units horizontally, each with the 7-radius border and the
    # BgBrush ground. The row sits under the widget, left edges aligned; this capture is of
    # the ROW WINDOW alone, so the widget is not in frame.
    #
    # A gauge direction that is the same on all four, or a fourth chicklet reading a
    # countdown instead of DUE, is the fold flattening a difference the two windows had —
    # which is precisely what this picture exists to catch and what no diff would show.
    # SHOT 2026-09-05: four chicklets, mez first, exactly as above — EXCEPT that the
    # PREDICTION had the three spawn chips in SEED order and they come out SOONEST-FIRST
    # (Bones DUE, Fright 9:50, Kizdean 28:50). That is not a render bug and not a staging
    # bug: SpawnTimers.Snapshot has always ordered by DueAt, and HudChipRow.Merge preserves
    # each family's own order rather than imposing one. The prediction was written from the
    # seed list instead of from the family's order; corrected above rather than quietly
    # accepted (trap 23 — a mismatch is a fixture bug until proven otherwise, and this one
    # was proven a prediction bug in one read of Snapshot).
    #
    # RE-PREDICTION for #425, written BEFORE the re-shoot: the SAME four chicklets, the same
    # order, the same faces and the same gauges — stacked VERTICALLY instead of left to
    # right, one per line, separated by the same 3 units. The owner's lock flips the
    # container's orientation and nothing else, so anything about an individual chicklet
    # that changes in this picture is a bug in the flip rather than the point of it. The
    # capture becomes tall and narrow: roughly one chicklet wide, four tall.
    #
    # RE-PREDICTION for DRA-352 D1, written BEFORE the re-shoot. The row is SPLIT: this title
    # is now the FIGHT row, so the capture holds ONE chicklet — the moon "Skeleton" with its
    # counting mm:ss and draining gauge — and its name AND countdown are BLUE (MezChipBrush;
    # Turquoise's #6CB4F0 at the default -Theme), not the old text-white name and accent
    # countdown. The three spawn chips moved to 'hud-chips-spawn' below, off the SAME seed.
    # A spawn chicklet in this picture is the split leaking; a white mez name is the ink
    # table not reaching the renderer.
    # SHOT 2026-09-23, 108x35: one chicklet, "Skeleton 0:13", as predicted. Pixel-sampled
    # rather than eyeballed: the text runs are #6CB4F0 (Turquoise's MezChipBrush), the moon
    # is TextBrush #E0F2EF and the gauge fill is the accent #3FCFBE.

    # SA-3's TWO NET-NEW FAMILIES on that same row — a watch rule that has just fired, and a
    # buff inside its expiry warning window. A NEW name, checked first (trap 21): nothing
    # embeds 'hud-chips-deadlines', and 'hud-chips' stays exactly as SA-2 shot it — that
    # picture is a reviewed record of the FOLD, and superseding it with a busier one would

    #
    # This is the only shot in the file that needs lines read while the app is RUNNING
    # (AppendLive, added with it). A watch rule staged the ordinary way is a rule that
    # correctly does nothing: the startup replay fires no banners, on purpose.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written BEFORE the shot (trap 23). ONE horizontal row of FIVE chicklets,
    # left to right, in HudChipRow.DefaultOrder — which is the first picture there has ever
    # been of all four families at once, and is the order SA-4's setting will default to:
    #   1. MEZ, moon: "Skeleton", counting mm:ss, gauge DRAINING.
    #   2. SPAWN, timer: "Bones Brackins" reading the word DUE in warn ink, warn border,
    #      gauge SOLID in the bad ink. Spawn chips are soonest-first, so the overdue one
    #      leads (the correction SA-2's own prediction earned).
    #   3. SPAWN, timer: "Kizdean Gix" near 28:5x, gauge FILLING and barely started.
    #   4. WATCH-FIRE, bell: "Assist call" — the RULE'S name, not the line it matched —
    #      counting its 30 s linger down, so about 0:21-0:23 at an 8 s settle, gauge
    #      DRAINING. The matched line is in the tooltip, which a capture cannot show.
    #   5. BUFF, hourglass: "Stalwart Regeneration" reading about "0:52 est" — the shortest
    #      buff in the shipped catalog is 60 s, so it lands INSIDE the DEFAULT 60 s warning
    #      window and this needs no cranked setting to exist. Gauge DRAINING, nearly full:
    #      it is measured against the WARNING WINDOW, not the spell. Cast by Sanctari rather
    #      than by You, so Spell Casting Reinforcement cannot lengthen the estimate and make
    #      the number here depend on the fixture's AAs.
    # Two chicklets reading DUE, or a bell and a timer drawn as the same shape, is the
    # net-new half failing exactly where #148/#166 says it fails — and no diff shows it.
    # SHOT 2026-09-05, 694x32: five chicklets, five DISTINCT vectors, in the predicted order
    # and with every number inside its predicted range — "Skeleton 0:13", "Bones Brackins
    # DUE" (warn ink, warn border), "Kizdean Gix 28:50", "Assist call 0:22", "Stalwart

    #
    # It is the purest trap 22 case in the file: the mode is reached only by a human opening
    # the widget's context menu and clicking a row, and the four editors exist on a profile
    # with NOTHING running — which is the state the mode is for and the one nothing else can
    # photograph. EQBUDDY_HUDEDIT is the hook.

    # both states. The default state is this picture minus the dim.
    #
    # PREDICTION, written BEFORE the shot (trap 23). ONE horizontal row of FOUR editor
    # chicklets in HudChipOrder order, each with an ACCENT border (the mode's one visual
    # difference from a live chicklet), then a dim wrapped hint line with no border:
    #   1. "Mez & slow", moon emblem, ◀ DIMMED and disabled (it is leftmost), ✓ in accent, ▶ live.
    #   2. "Spawn timers", timer emblem, MUTED: emblem and label in DimBrush, the toggle an
    #      ✕ in warn ink. Both arrows live.
    #   3. "Watch alerts", BELL emblem beside a ✓ toggle — two DIFFERENT vectors, which is the
    #      whole reason the toggle is not itself a bell.
    #   4. "Buffs", hourglass emblem, ▶ DIMMED and disabled (it is rightmost), ✓ in accent.
    # No live chip anywhere: the fixture profile has no timer, no mez, no fired rule and no
    # buff, and the row is up regardless — that is the capability the mode adds.
    # Two chicklets reading as the same shape, or an end arrow drawn as though it were live
    # (trap 17 — IsEnabled has no disabled visual in this app's styles), is what this picture
    # exists to catch and what no diff shows.
    #
    # RE-PREDICTION for #425, written BEFORE the re-shoot. The four editors are the same four
    # in the same order, stacked VERTICALLY — and three things about them change with the
    # column, all of them deliberate:
    #   • The nudges are CHEVRON UP and CHEVRON DOWN, not left and right. An arrow pointing
    #     left on a column describes a row that is not there. "Mez & slow" has its UP arrow
    #     dimmed and disabled (it is topmost); "Buffs" has its DOWN arrow dimmed (bottom).
    #   • A FIFTH editor chicklet after "Follow the HUD again": a chevron button and the
    #     words "Stack grows: Down" — the owner's toggle, reading the STATE. Its chevron
    #     points DOWN on this profile, matching the word beside it. A chevron that disagrees
    #     with the label is the one thing on this chicklet no test can see.
    #   • The hint line's wording follows: "up or down the stack", and it names the toggle.
    # "Spawn timers" stays muted, so the dim/live pair is still carried by one picture.
    #
    # RE-PREDICTION for DRA-352 D1, written BEFORE the re-shoot. Edit HUD opens on BOTH rows
    # and each family's editor is in the row that draws it, so THIS (fight-row) capture has
    # THREE family editors — "Mez & slow" (UP dimmed, topmost), "Watch alerts", "Buffs" (DOWN
    # dimmed, bottom) — then "Follow the HUD again (fight row)", "Stack grows: Down", Done,

    # past what the bounded tooltip can be read in, so it stayed by policy rather than by
    # oversight (`SettingsProsePass2Tests`). So is the alert-banner sentence near the top,
    # which the recipe below already asserts. The mez-duration rows this shot exists for are
    # untouched — if the picture no longer reaches them, the zoom needs revisiting, not the

    # PREDICTION since 2026-09-05 (HUD subtraction cuts 1 and 2): EIGHT rows in the card
    # list - Combat, Healing, Kills & Drops, Gear & Loot, Watch, Buffs, Progress, Motes -
    # with no "Quests" and no "World" among them, and none of the four notes those two
    # carried: no "Sky Quest / Epics are tabs in here now", and no "Travels & Deaths / Zone
    # map / Travel route / Spawn timers are tabs in here now". A note hangs under the
    # SURVIVING card and there is none in either case.
    #
    # This screen is the one #219 was filed from, so it is the picture that says out loud
    # what the two cuts cost: someone hunting for any of those six names finds no row here
    # at all. Recorded in HELM-FEEDBACK.md rather than papered over - and cut 2's half is
    # the bigger one, four names against two.
    #
    # AMENDED SA-3 (2026-09-05), and the amendment IS the re-shoot that was owed. The two
    # paragraphs above describe a gap that has been CLOSED: #335/#336 landed Bevel's
    # Options-gap ruling (I-11 section 4), so the six names are on this screen again, under a
    # "No longer on the widget" heading below the card rows - "Sky Quests / Epics ... are
    # tabs in the Quest tracker now", "Travels & Deaths / Zone map / Travel route / Spawn
    # timers ... are tabs in the World window". The committed PNG predated that and could not
    # show it, which is precisely why the re-shoot was owed rather than optional.
    # SHOT 2026-09-05, 420x439: eight card rows exactly as predicted (Combat, Healing, Kills &
    # Drops, Gear & Loot, Watch, Buffs, Progress, Motes), no Quests row, no World row, and the
    # retired list present with both sentences. Height dropped from the prior 420x490 prediction
    # because SR-2 moved the gear-checklist import block off this Options tab onto GearCardView
    # — that chrome is gone here (standing: soft re-shoot amends its own shoot.ps1 prediction
    # in-commit). The rest of the tab is unchanged.
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-08 for the prose-to-hover pass (Bevel's faces, Helm-signed). PREDICTED
    # BEFORE THE CAPTURE: the three headings ("What EQBuddy shows", "Mini dashboard",
    # "Floating windows") each carry an ⓘ with NO paragraph beneath, the double-click and
    # target-drops rows carry an ⓘ at the end of the row with their paragraphs gone, the two
    # notes under the mini-dashboard tick boxes and the short recent-rate line are STILL
    # PRINTED, and the window is materially SHORTER at the same 420 width.
    # SHOT: 420x392, down from 420x439, and every clause above held. The height is the
    # reviewable number here — five paragraphs left the body and the window sizes to its
    # content, so a re-shoot that came back the same height would mean the conversion had
    # only ADDED affordances and left the prose behind it (the duplicate half of
    # `SettingsProsePolicyTests`, which a source scan can see but a player cannot).
    #
    # RE-SHOT 2026-09-23 for DRA-352 D2 (Founder direction on the card's screenshot).
    # PREDICTED BEFORE THE CAPTURE: "What EQBuddy shows" + its ⓘ over the same eight card
    # rows with their three absorbed notes; NO "No longer on the widget" block under them
    # (Helm LOCKED the drop of OverlaySections.Retired); "Mini dashboard" + its ⓘ over the
    # tick boxes with NOTHING under them - no top-row note, no pet note, no Restore default
    # order button; NO "Floating windows" heading or tick list at all (its switch is the pin
    # on each floating window now); then the double-click and target-drops rows with their
    # ⓘ, and the Recent-rate row with its one-line caption. Materially SHORTER than 420x392:
    # three paragraphs, a button, a heading and a six-box list left the body.

    #
    #   'zone-map-target' — the same window as 'zone-map' with THREE things staged that the
    #     row above deliberately has none of: a map pack, a tracked goal, and a kill with a
    #     fresh /loc behind it. Put the two side by side and the difference is exactly this
    #     slice plus the pack, which is why the no-pack row stays rather than being upgraded.
    #
    #   THE EXHIBIT IS THE SHIPPED CATALOGS' OWN, not a fixture's: Blackened Wand's item page
    #   names Priest Amiaz in Befallen, and the spawn catalog knows him as one of Befallen's
    #   nameds. So the ringed dot also carries a REAL learned countdown (S14) rather than the
    #   ordinary point's projection — a shot staged on an invented creature would photograph
    #   the estimate arm and say nothing about the one the slice claims (trap 23).
    #
    #   THE LINES ARE `AppendLive`, and they have to be. The point archives only where a kill
    #   lands near a /loc the app has already read, and the startup replay deliberately does
    #   not re-fire; staged through `Append` this would be a correct no-op photographed as a
    #   broken feature, which is the trap the AppendLive comment above was written for.
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23), before the take:
    #     * The World window on its Map tab, drawing the staged square with the /loc marker
    #       at map (-200, -100) — the FromLoc inversion of "100, 200".
    #     * ONE spawn circle wearing the accent (Priest Amiaz is a catalog named), with a
    #       DASHED ring around it and no recolouring of the circle itself.
    #     * A side panel headed "Going after — Befallen" ABOVE "Named — Befallen": one goal
    #       row naming Blackened Wand and Priest Amiaz, then "1 of your 1 archived spawn
    #       points here is one of these", then the note saying EQBuddy does not know where
    #       anything spawns.
    #     * NO "Drops somewhere else" heading — Blackened Wand's page names Befallen and
    #       nowhere else, which is the honest single-zone case.
    #
    #   TAKEN 2026-09-20 AND EVERY PREDICTION HELD. One thing the prediction did not cover and
    #   the picture does: the /loc marker, the spawn circle, its target ring and the camp pin
    #   all land on the SAME spot, because one /loc staged both the position and the kill. That
    #   is a true consequence of the staging rather than a layout defect — a real session
    #   /locs in several places — but it does make the dashed ring hard to read at the fitted
    #   zoom. Said here rather than restyled: the density question is Bevel's, and trap 79's
    #   rule is that you do not change the product because of what a capture looks like.

    #   'zone-map-guide' — 'zone-map-target''s staging shape for the SECOND layer: a pack, a
    #   TRACKED QUEST (not a tracked upgrade), and a kill with a fresh /loc behind it.
    #
    #   THE EXHIBIT IS D1's, off the shipped catalogs (trap 23): Armor of Ro Quests needs a
    #   Nightfall Giant's Head, whose item page names "a nightfall giant" in West Commonlands
    #   (map file commons.txt). The kill is the dropper's own log spelling, so the strict name
    #   fold is what joins it — no fuzzy match is involved. `AppendLive` for the reason the
    #   row above gives.
    #
    #   PREDICTED (trap 23), before the take:
    #     * The World window on Map, the staged square, the /loc marker at map (-200, -100).
    #     * ONE dim (ordinary, not named) spawn circle with a solid DIAMOND round it in the
    #       theme's good ink — and NO dashed ring, because nothing is tracked in the gear layer.
    #     * A side panel headed "Guide steps — West Commonlands" ABOVE "Named — …": step rows
    #       for Armor of Ro's West Commonlands steps (Nightfall Giant's Head, Sand of Ro), then
    #       "1 of your 1 archived spawn points here serves one of these steps.", then the note

    #       "Going after" and "Guide steps" — filled.
    #
    #   TAKEN 2026-09-30. Held: the diamond (and no dashed ring), the block above "Named", the
    #   points line and the note, both chips filled. TWO MISSES, both true of the fixture rather
    #   than defects: (1) the circle is a NAMED, not an ordinary dot — the spawn catalog knows
    #   Nightfall Giant in West Commonlands, so the kill also started a learned countdown and
    #   planted its camp pin on the same spot; (2) the rows are not only Armor of Ro's — the
    #   shared fixture's own ledger has STARTED other quests with steps here (Assist the Great
    #   Xelha, Monk Sash Quests), which are the Relevant group, so the block lists four rows and
    #   counts "4 more", exactly the cap's sentence.

    # THE TRAVELS TAB, which had no recipe until 2026-09-05 and did not need one: it was
    # the one World room the WIDGET drew, on the misc card, so EQBUDDY_EXPAND=1 put it in
    # 'widget-expanded' for free. HUD subtraction cut 2 removed that card, which would have
    # left the surface unphotographable and therefore unreviewable-but-looking-reviewed
    # (trap 22) - so EQBUDDY_WORLD landed with the cut and this row landed with the hook.
    # It is also the illustration lock working the way it is supposed to: a capture arrives
    # WITH its recipe, in the same change.
    #
    # PREDICTION: the World window, native chrome reading "World", a four-chip strip (Map
    # badged with the fixture's last zone, Camps, Path, Travels - Travels lit), and under it
    # the Travels body: a "Deaths" heading with no rows (the fixture has no death line), a
    # "Zones visited" heading over SIX rows with times - the replay zones Befallen / West
    # Commonlands / Befallen / West Commonlands / East Commonlands / West Commonlands - and
    # NO markers heading at all (MarkersLabel collapses when the list is empty). Pinned
    # BELOW the body, exactly once: the "Drop camp marker" action row with the "Show in mini
    # dashboard" star and its label, which appear on the Travels tab alone - that star is
    # the only writer MiniStats has for 'deaths', and this shot is the only picture of it.
    #
    # TWO PREDICTION MISSES ON THE FIRST RUN, and the second is why this row was worth
    # adding at all. (a) "Befallen and West Commonlands" undercounted: the fixture zones
    # SIX times, not twice, and the number came from a doc line rather than from the log -
    # trap 23's rule is to derive the prediction, and a phrase copied from another comment
    # is not a derivation. (b) "Drop camp marker" appeared TWICE, once inside the scroller
    # and once pinned. That was not new: `TravelsView` inserted its own copy at the top of
    # the body FOR THE INLINE CARD - its own doc comment said so - while both surviving
    # hosts pin one as chrome. It had rendered twice since the World fold in a window no
    # committed illustration had ever photographed. The in-body copy went with the card.

    # a tab nobody photographs is a tab nobody reviews (trap 22).
    #
    # THE FILENAME STAYS 'drops-window' even though the window did not. README.md embeds
    # docs/screenshots/drops-window.png, and a shot name IS a filename (trap 21) — renaming
    # it here would leave a broken image in the README and a stale PNG in the repo. The
    # TITLE had to change, because that is what the capture matches on.

# `install-local.ps1 -Evolved` copy have it open. Only the widget's OnClosed finalizes the
# session into history.db and calls Application.Current.Shutdown(); closing the shell
# instead leaves the app running, which costs a prime run its stored session (staged
# history that silently is not there — trap 23's shape) and costs the stand-down a hard
# kill of a real player's session.
#
# The widget's title is exactly "EQBuddy"; the shell's carries its room. Returns $false
# when no such window is up, so the caller can fall back rather than assume.

# --- THE SCREEN IS A MUTEX, AND UNTIL NOW NOTHING ENFORCED IT ----------------------
#
# `FABLE.md` §4 says it in as many words: *"The one hard mutex is the SCREEN … Dranak
# enforces this by kick order, not by tooling."* A convention with no interlock fails
# silently, and this is what the failure looks like from inside a batch:
#
#   `Get-Process EQBuddy` matches every EQBuddy on the machine by PROCESS NAME. Another
#   seat's `shoot.ps1` starting up therefore stands down THIS batch's in-flight fixture
#   app — and records its exe path for a relaunch it will do, with no EQBUDDY_APPDATA,
#   into the real profile. The shot that was mid-settle then finds its window gone:
#   *"no visible window matching 'EQBuddy — Gear' in process N"*. Three different rows
#   failed across three runs of #306's batch, each passing alone, and `DECISIONS.md`
#   (2026-09-05) already records the cause in one line: *"another seat's EQBuddy was
#   running on the same desktop … multi-shot runs died at a different shell shot each
#   time and every one of them passed alone."* The row that fails is whichever one was on
#   screen when the other seat started; nothing about it is a defect in that row.
#
# Two guards, because they catch different collisions:
#
#   1. A LOCK FILE held for the whole batch. It cannot go stale — the handle dies with the
#      process — and it is opened FileShare.Read so a refused seat can say WHO holds it.
#      This is the opposite call from UI.Shared/SingleInstance, deliberately: there, a
#      widget that will not launch is worse than two of them; here, a batch that runs
#      anyway corrupts someone else's acceptance criterion at a random row.
#   2. A RUNNING EQBUDDY OUT OF A BUILD OUTPUT. `tests/EQBuddy.E2E` launches the same exe
#      and takes no lock, so the lock alone cannot see it. A player's EQBuddy never runs
#      from `bin\Release`; a harness's always does, which makes the path the discriminator
#      — the same "what does the real thing actually write" move Core/GameWrittenLog makes
#      for log names (trap 48).
#
# -Force overrides both, for the case where the holder is known dead. It does NOT make the
# stand-down touch a build-output app: closing another harness's fixture app is the damage.

# real character name into docs/screenshots/. That has bitten three times: twice after
# release.ps1 reinstalled and relaunched it, and once as a Faction tab filed under
# another shot's name. -OwnerPid (shot.ps1) stops the wrong window being photographed;
# this stops the wrong window being on screen at all.

# from the `finally` with no EQBUDDY_APPDATA, pointing a stray widget at the real profile.
