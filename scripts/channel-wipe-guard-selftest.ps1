.SYNOPSIS
    Drive scripts/channel-wipe-guard.ps1 into the red once per check, and prove it stays
    green on the things it must not fire on.

.DESCRIPTION
    A guard is only as good as its worst false negative, and a guard nobody has watched
    FAIL is a green light with no bulb behind it (trap 34). This builds a throwaway git
    repository in TEMP - never this repo, never the real channel files - seeds it with
    fixture ledgers, and then does each destructive thing on purpose.

    Thirty-three cases. Eight of them are "must PASS" on purpose: the useful half of a guard
    like this is the workflows it does NOT interrupt, and every one of the passes below
    corresponds to a real commit in this repo's history that must keep landing (a drained
    inbox, a lifted hold, an encoding repair, an archive move, a rebase that reorders).

    The marker-array bug this suite would have caught, and did: the mojibake check was
    written as `@([char]0xE2 + [char]0x20AC, [char]0xC3 + [char]0xA2)`, and PowerShell
    binds `,` TIGHTER than `+`, so the list collapsed into one string that matches
    nothing. The guard reported a clean file for the commit that quadrupled the
    corruption. It was green, and it was measuring nothing.

    Case 2 is that lesson applied to the ENTRY arm before it could repeat: it asserts the
    exact number of entries compared, because every 3b case here would still pass if
    $EntryPattern found none at all.

    Cases 15 and 16 are the pair worth reading together. They are one commit - an encoding
    repair that also drops fifteen of sixty entries - asserted twice: that check 3a was
    EXCUSED as a repair, and that check 3b refused it anyway. That commit was green before
    3b existed, and it is the reason the REPAIR exemption deliberately does not reach the
    entry arm.
