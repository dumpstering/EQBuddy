.SYNOPSIS
    Claim a Soft / Claude seat for one work item, or refuse it because another
    live seat already holds that item.

.DESCRIPTION
    Experiment A' on EQBuddy (the lab), 2026-09-08 — not a Corps standard.
    Soft max ≤3 is a count, not a mutex. This is the smallest mechanical refuse
    so we can measure it: one JSON store on the machine, shared by every worktree
    of this clone, gitignored so it cannot become a mailbox rebase war.

    Since DRA-102 (DRA-95 A', Helm-signed 2026-09-16) the refusal crosses
    independent CLONES too, by union-READ / local-WRITE. A machine-level
    registry of store PATHS (%LOCALAPPDATA%\DranakCorps\soft-seats\stores.json,
    no claim data) records each clone's resolved store the first time it runs
    these scripts; a claim reads every registered store and writes only its own.
    Registry absent, unreadable or EQBUDDY_SOFT_SEAT_REGISTRY=off degrades to
    the pre-DRA-102 behaviour, and a grant decided that way says so.
    -Where prints every store consulted, not just the resolved one.

    INVOKE THIS SCRIPT RESOLVED, through the clone's MAIN checkout (DRA-107,
    Helm-signed 2026-09-16):

        pwsh -NoProfile -File "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/claim-seat.ps1" ...

    A linked worktree shares its clone's STORE (correct, DRA-90) but carries its
    OWN checkout of this file. Invoked by the bare relative path from a stale
    worktree, a pre-DRA-102 copy runs, consults no registry, and GRANTS the
    cross-clone duplicate DRA-102 closed — measured on the same card in the same
    second: local copy "OK: claimable", resolved copy REFUSED naming the foreign
    holder. --git-common-dir answers the clone's .git from a linked worktree and
    from the main checkout alike, so one invocation is right everywhere. Needs
    git >= 2.31 for --path-format=absolute. The bare relative form still works
    and is DEMOTED, not removed: it is correct from a main checkout, wrong from a
    stale worktree, and cannot tell you which one you are in.

    -WorkItem IS the Paperclip card id, DRA-<n>, and nothing else (EXO-HARDEN-A2
    / DRA-50, 2026-09-10). A bare GitHub issue number is refused with the reason,
    never silently mapped onto a card: #445 and DRA-28 are two names for one
    scope, and the mutex only refuses a second seat that spells the key the same
    way. See scripts/soft-seat-store.ps1.

    Default (-Mode active) fails when ANY other live seat holds the work item —
    active, challenger, disjoint or replacement (DRA-76 / DRA-73 plan SS2.2,
    2026-09-14). Only an abandoned claim releases the item. It used to refuse
    only against an EXCLUSIVE holder, which let a default executor start beside
    a live challenger or disjoint seat: two executors, one card, neither refused.
    That is what PRs #566/#568 cost.

    -Mode challenger|disjoint|replacement is the explicit override and is never
    refused — a second seat is a choice somebody made, not a default that
    happened. Same-seat re-claim is idempotent. The recovery for a holder that
    is gone is release-seat.ps1 -ForceStale, and the refusal names it (plus
    every holder, and which of them look stale).

    Optional -PaperclipIssue: opts in to writing the card to in_progress on a
    successful claim (Phase 0 EXO-HARDEN-AGENTS / DRA-18). It must EQUAL
    -WorkItem — there is one key, not two. Omit it to claim without touching
    Paperclip. PRE-STATE: the card must already be ASSIGNED to the working role.
    claim-seat never assigns (DRA-399), and Paperclip refuses in_progress on an
    unassigned card (422). That write is best-effort — the claim still exits 0
    — but since DRA-467 a failed write prints a WARNING with the API error
    instead of a bare line that reads like success.

    Since DRA-110 (Helm-signed 2026-09-22) a row records the mode it was GRANTED
    under in its own field, granted_mode, apart from the lifecycle status.
    status was doing two jobs: the mode has always been written into it, but
    every transition that ends a seat overwrites it (abandoned on release and on
    -ForceStale, abandoned on the rows a replacement takes over, the new mode on
    a same-seat re-claim), so 150 of 166 rows measured on this machine no longer
    state the mode they were granted under. That is why the disputed DRA-106
    grant can be neither ruled in nor out: an explicit -Mode is never refused, by
    design, and a row that has ended cannot say which it was.

    granted_mode is written ONCE, when the row is created, and by nothing else.
    -List and the refusal text below both print it through one producer.

    A re-claim that escalates the mode shows as the PAIR, not in this field: a
    row that entered as active and re-claimed as challenger reads "challenger
    since <t>, granted as active". granted_mode answers how the row got IN;
    status answers where it is now.

    FORWARD-ONLY. Every row written before this shipped lacks the field and
    prints "granted mode not recorded (row predates DRA-110; NOT a default
    claim)" — never a blank, because a silent omission is what a reader fills in
    with "default claim", and that is the one wrong answer about a row that
    never recorded one. Nothing defaults it to 'active'.

    It does NOT record which stores were consulted at grant time (registry
    union-read on / off / absent — the -Where distinction). That is a second
    fact with its own writer and it was refused as scope creep in the same
    ruling; it is the one that would actually explain the 40 s DRA-106 grant.

    scheduled_tasks.lock and %TEMP%\eqbuddy-screen.lock are NOT Soft seat claims.
    Not a scheduler, not a control plane, never writes HELM-FEEDBACK.md.
    Formal proposal lands in the control-plane repo; this file only verifies.
