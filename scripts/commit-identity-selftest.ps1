.SYNOPSIS
    The prove-fail for `commit-identity-guard.ps1`: every refusal driven RED at least
    once, and every shape the policy ALLOWS driven green.

.DESCRIPTION
    DRA-226. A detector nobody has watched fire is a detector aimed at nothing - trap 34
    (a guard that forbids the wrong thing cannot see a missing thing) and trap 78 (a
    detector whose pattern list silently collapsed matched nothing and reported clean for
    a month). This is the copy of that lesson for the commit-identity guard, and it runs
    in CI beside the guard itself.

    It builds a THROWAWAY repository under the run's temp directory - never the live one -
    and drives the guard over commits it authored on purpose. The green half matters as
    much as the red half here: a guard that refuses the Founder's email is one bad
    allow-list row away from refusing the bot's too, and every pull request in the
    repository would then be red for a reason nobody changed.

    The two properties worth naming, because they are the ones that would rot quietly:

    ALL SIX REFUSALS FIRE. Author, committer, the right-name/wrong-email shape that
    started DRA-226, a stranger, a stranger under the Founder's own door, and a single bad
    commit buried in a run of good ones.

    ALL OF `main` STAYS UNJUDGED. `main` holds 126 commits the guard would refuse, so
    "it only judges what the pull request adds" is not a nicety - it is the difference
    between a gate and a permanent red light. Case 8 commits the Founder's identity onto
    `main` and asserts the guard says so out loud rather than passing silently.
