.SYNOPSIS
    No commit a pull request ADDS may be authored or committed as anyone but the bot.

.DESCRIPTION
    DRA-226. Every commit on three open DRA-216 delivery branches was authored AND
    committed as `David Edwards <david.edwards08@gmail.com>` - seven commits, 4,589 lines
    of agent-written code, about to land in `git blame` under the name of the one person
    in this company whose signature carries release accountability. A Planner review
    caught it because somebody happened to read the commit authors.

    THE MEASUREMENT THAT SIZED IT. Of the last 600 commits on `main` at the time this
    landed, 126 already carry `david.edwards08@gmail.com` - 121 as `David Edwards`, 5 as
    `DranakCorps-bot`. The three pull requests were not the incident; they were the one
    instance anybody noticed, at about a eighteenth of the real scale.

    THE CAUSE, because a guard should say what it is guarding against. There is more than
    one EQBuddy working tree on the Founder's machine and each carries its own `[user]`
    block, because `~/.gitconfig` has none. `C:\Users\david\source\EQBuddy` - an active
    agent dispatch lane with ~20 linked worktrees under %TEMP% on `claude/*` and
    `sr-exec/*` branches - resolved `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` to
    `David Edwards <david.edwards08@gmail.com>`. A linked worktree SHARES its clone's
    config, so one wrong `[user]` block mis-attributed every worktree hanging off it. Two
    more trees carried the Founder's email under a different name (`Fable 5`, and
    `DranakCorps-bot` in run-scratch clones), which is why this reads EMAIL and not name.

    WHY A CI CHECK AND NOT JUST THE CONFIG FIX. Fixing the three trees fixes today's
    machine. It does nothing about the next fresh clone, the next run-scratch checkout, or
    the next dispatch lane - all three of which have already happened once. This is the
    copy that does not depend on the environment being right.

    IT JUDGES ONLY WHAT THE PULL REQUEST ADDS. The range is HEAD minus the base AND minus
    `main`, so a commit already on `main` is never judged by it. That is not politeness:
    `main` holds 126 commits this guard would refuse, so a check that read history would
    be permanently, uselessly red and would teach everyone to ignore it (trap 74 - a gate
    that reddens for a reason nobody changed is a gate nobody believes).

    WHAT IT READS IS THE EMAIL, ON BOTH IDENTITIES. GitHub attributes a commit by email,
    so `DranakCorps-bot <david.edwards08@gmail.com>` renders on the pull request page as
    "David Edwards" no matter what the name field says - which is exactly how five of
    those commits got read as the Founder's. Name is REPORTED so a human can see what
    happened, and weighs nothing. Author and committer are checked separately because a
    rebase, a cherry-pick or an `--amend` moves them independently, and half a check is a
    check with a hole the size of the other half.

    THE FOUNDER'S OWN DOOR (-AllowFounder) is deliberate, explicit and narrow, and it
    exists because banning the repo owner from his own repository is not an acceptable
    fix. The honest problem is that an agent running inside the Founder's clone produces a
    commit BYTE-IDENTICAL in identity to one he types himself; no rule read off the commit
    object can separate them. So the separation has to come from outside the object: a
    human puts the `founder-commit` label on the pull request, `ci.yml` passes this switch,
    and the Founder's identity joins the allow-list FOR THAT PULL REQUEST ONLY. Every
    other unknown identity is still refused with the switch on - the door admits one named
    person, it does not stand the guard down. The label is visible on the pull request, it
    is recorded in the event, and an agent cannot apply one.

    FAILING OPEN IS DELIBERATE IN EXACTLY TWO PLACES, and both of them SAY SO on stdout:
    an unresolvable base (a shallow checkout with no merge base), and an empty range (a
    pull request that adds no commit of its own). Both print a loud SKIPPED/EMPTY line,
    because an empty range is precisely how a broken range computation would read as
    green, and a guard that cannot tell "I checked nothing" from "I checked and it was
    fine" is the one that goes quiet the day it breaks.

.PARAMETER BaseRef
    The commit the pull request is based on. Defaults to `origin/main`, which makes the
    local invocation argument-free: from a feature branch it judges exactly your own
    commits. CI passes the pull request's base sha.

.PARAMETER HeadRef
    The tip to judge. Defaults to HEAD. On a `pull_request` run CI passes the pull
    request's HEAD sha rather than HEAD, because `actions/checkout` leaves the MERGE
    RESULT checked out and that merge commit is authored by GitHub, not by the author.

.PARAMETER AllowFounder
    Add the Founder's own identity to the allow-list for this run. See above - this is
    the `founder-commit` label's door, not a general off switch.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/commit-identity-guard.ps1
    Judge every commit on the current branch that is not already on origin/main.
