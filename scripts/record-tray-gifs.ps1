# GIF fixture for the minimized tray (DRA-48): the real EQBuddy.exe on an isolated

# the bar. The illustration lock (CLAUDE.md) says an illustration of our own UI is a
# capture with a recipe — shoot.ps1 is the recipe for stills, and this is the recipe for
# the landing page's interaction GIFs. Everything it shows is the shipped behavior of
# HudBarView / HudExpandBar / HudExpandWindow, reached the way a player reaches it: with
# the pointer.

# THE SCREEN IS A MUTEX (trap 61): this takes the same eqbuddy-screen.lock as shoot.ps1
# and tests/EQBuddy.E2E, refuses over a foreign fixture app, stands the player's EQBuddy
# down gracefully and relaunches it in finally. Synthetic input makes the lock MORE
# load-bearing here, not less — a stray window under the cursor would be clicked.

# Every GIF gets its own app launch on a fresh settings.json, for trap 51's reason: a

# promised "what dropped and at what rate" and the committed `hud-expand-loot.png` two
# sections below showed a Giant spider drop table. One landing, two answers.
#
# A /consider is a target for the same `TargetLinger` 45 seconds a finished fight is
# (`SessionStats.BuildCurrentTargetsLocked`), and it is the affordance the peek's own empty
# line names — so it is the honest way to stage one. The window never lapses here: the linger
# is measured from the log's LAST EVENT, and this line is it, so `last - con.Time` stays 0 for
# the whole take no matter how long the settle runs.

# PREDICTION for the DRA-62 re-take, written before the run (trap 23). The gesture is
# unchanged; only what the Loot panel CONTAINS should differ from the shipped clip:
#   * The peek opens 300 wide (the fixed width since OE-7) with the bag vector, "Loot", ↗, ✕.
#   * Its subtext is no longer "No target". It reads the creature and its provenance —
#     "Giant spider" then a kill count from the fixture's own twelve slain giant spiders and
#     "· drops (eqlwiki · CACHED <today>)". CACHED, not LIVE and not OFFLINE: the seed is
#     written with a FetchedAt of now, so the 7-day lifetime is satisfied from disk and
#     nothing is fetched. A panel reading OFFLINE or "looking up…" means the seed missed.
#   * The body is DROP ROWS, not the invitation sentence: Spider Legs, Spider Silk and
#     Spider Venom Sac, each "N this session · N%" off the fixture's own loot lines, observed
#     rows leading. The `$DropsFixtureWiki` seed for Giant spider is Spider Silk + Spider
#     Legs, both of which the fixture already looted, so it should add NO fourth row — its
#     job here is the state label and the absence of a fetch, not extra rows.
#   * Then the pointer slides to DPS and the panel follows, as before, and the away-move
#     collapses it. Those two beats are the shipped clip's and should look like it.
# A take that still says "No target" cannot reach the GIF: Wait-PeekSays throws first.
#
# TAKE 1 (2026-09-11): every content claim above HELD — "Giant spider · 15 kills this session
# · drops (eqlwiki · CACHED …)" with Spider Silk 5 / Spider Legs 4 / Spider Venom Sac 2, no
# fourth row, nothing fetched. And the clip was still not shippable: the chip's tooltip sat
# over the panel's header and subtext for the whole dwell, so the creature line was legible
# only in fragments. The prediction had nothing to say about occlusion and the assertion
# could not see it — which is the finding. TAKE 2 adds the move onto the panel below.
#
# TAKE 2: subtext confirmed verbatim by the assertion — "Giant spider — 15 kills this session
# · drops (eqlwiki · CACHED 9/11)". CACHED is the load-bearing word: the seed answered and
# nothing was fetched. Still not shippable — the rest-point was inside the panel's resize
# edge, so an edge cursor and an edge tooltip replaced the chip's. TAKE 3 rests dead centre.

# --- the trailer take --------------------------------------------------------------
# Two ways to stage it, and the first is the one the trailer ships:
#
#   -SourceLog <eqlog_Name_server.txt> -CutAt 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'
#     A PLAYER'S OWN LOG (David's Dranak, with his permission, 2026-09-28). Everything up to
#     the cut is copied into the throwaway profile as the character's history, every stamp
#     shifted by one constant so the cut lands on "now" — so the app rebuilds his real
#     sessions, zones, kills and loot exactly as it would have on the day. The lines AFTER
#     the cut are appended during the take at the pace they were played, so every number
#     that moves on camera moves because the shipped parser read a line he actually played.
#     His /outputfile dumps are copied beside the Logs folder, where the game writes them.
#     The source file is only ever READ; nothing is written near it (trap 69's spirit).
#
#   no -SourceLog
#     The Testchar fixture with a small invented fight — kept so the take still runs on a
#     machine with no real log, and labelled here as invented.
#
# Either way the loadout is scaled up so it stays crisp in a 1080p frame, and both chip rows
# are PARKED where a player keeps them (left and right of the play area, under a bar across
# the top) — screen coordinates, which is why this runs here and not in $GifSeed.
# The staging itself is scripts/real-log-staging.ps1, shared with shoot.ps1.

#     (the Mote of Major Potential off Ssynthi at 14:46) and coin; HPS is on it, because he
#     heals Varab through the fight.
#   * Left, "Interrupt: Shock of Blades" arrives about 3 s in, when a pledge familiar casts
#     it, and re-arms at ~11 s and ~15 s.
#   * Right, the spawn row holds whatever his kills leave running — Ssynthi (Castle
#     Mistmoore), killed 14:31 and again 14:46, if its timer has not run out. Staged NOTHING.
#   * Hover the loot chip: the peek names the creature he is fighting. Then DPS.
#   * ~18 s: "You have slain a pledge familiar!" + Rusty Short Sword +4; ~27 s: another +
#     Rusty Broad Sword +4. Loot count and XP move on those beats, and on nothing invented.
