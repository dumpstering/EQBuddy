# Build the current tree and silently install it on THIS machine only — the standing
# loop for testing changes before a release (David's rule: everything gets field-tested
# locally first). Touches neither OneDrive nor GitHub; the family keeps whatever
# release.ps1 last shipped. The updater won't fight it: it only ever offers NEWER
# versions than the one running.
#
#   pwsh scripts\install-local.ps1
#
# -Evolved is the 2.x loop, and it does NOT install. EQBuddy Evolved is under
# construction: it builds and signs the same way, then runs PORTABLE out of dist\publish
# against its own profile directory, so David keeps a working v1 install and an untouched
# v1 profile the whole time it is being built.
#
# The reason for that changed on 2026-09-07 and the behaviour deliberately did not. It
# used to be that installing an Evolved build would REPLACE v1 in place — one AppId, one
# {autopf}\EQBuddy — and inherit its settings.json, history.db and archives. TR-2 closed
# that: installer\EQBuddyEvolved.iss has its own AppId, its own install directory and its
# own shortcut, so the "heavier version" this comment used to name as a future move now
# exists and installs BESIDE v1. What keeps this loop portable is what it is FOR: a fast
# build-and-run against an isolated profile with the shell's review door open, which is a
# smoke rather than a deployment. Switching David's Evolved testing to an installed copy
# is the daily-driver call, and it is his; nothing here presumes it.
#
# -Evolved also opens the SHELL (EQBUDDY_SHELL=1), because a local Evolved smoke that does
# not show the thing E-3 is building is a smoke of the half that has not changed. It is a
# review door, not a player one, and it is set only on this branch — see the launch block
# below. scripts\Launch-Evolved-Shell.cmd re-opens the same portable copy without rebuilding.
#
#   pwsh scripts\install-local.ps1 -Evolved
#
# -Evolved -Install is THE DAILY DRIVER (David, 2026-09-29: "I want my version to always be
# the latest dev build ... I'm always running the latest code, live or incremental dev
# builds"). That is the call the paragraph above left to him, made. It builds and signs
# exactly as -Evolved does, then swaps the signed exe INTO the installed EQBuddy Evolved and
# relaunches it on the real profile:
#   * the exe it replaces becomes EQBuddy.previous.exe - the installer's own convention, so
#     the Start-menu "EQBuddy Evolved (previous version)" entry is a one-click rollback to
#     the build before this one;
#   * nothing else in the install directory is touched, so the uninstaller, the AppId and
#     the updater's installed-copy test (unins000.exe beside the exe) are exactly as the
#     release left them;
#   * no EQBUDDY_APPDATA and no EQBUDDY_SHELL: it runs as the player's app, on the player's
#     profile, which is the whole point of a daily driver.
# It refuses when there is no install to swap into - creating one is the signed installer's
# job - and it builds WHATEVER TREE IT IS RUN FROM, so "the latest code" is decided by the
# checkout: `main` for merged work, a local integration branch for work awaiting a smoke.
# The updater cannot fight it: it only offers a release NEWER than the running version, and
# a dev build carries Directory.Build.props' version, which is never behind the last tag.
#
#   pwsh scripts\install-local.ps1 -Evolved -Install
#
# BUILD FIRST, CLOSE LAST (DRA-705 §3). Both modes publish and sign into dist\publish-staged
# while whatever is running keeps running; only a signed build in hand closes the app. This
# used to close BEFORE `dotnet publish`, which is harmless with a person watching and wrong
# once scripts\auto-roll.ps1 runs it unattended: a failed build would leave the Founder with
# no EQBuddy at all. Under -Install the roll then:
#   * relaunches ONLY IF a copy was running - if he had it closed, the next time he opens it
#     is the new build;
#   * requires the relaunched build to still be alive at 20 s, and on a failed swap or an
#     early death copies EQBuddy.previous.exe back and relaunches THAT ("keep the last good
#     build" as one rule);
#   * writes EQBuddy.build.json beside the exe - the commit, its subject, the merged PR, when,
#     and which loop installed it. auto-roll.ps1 reads `pendingCommits` from it to hold off
#     while a manual PR-smoke install is not yet on main (DRA-705 §7).
