.SYNOPSIS
    Drive scripts/channel-size-guard.ps1 into the red once per arm, and prove it stays
    green on the things it must not fire on.

.DESCRIPTION
    A ratchet nobody has watched REFUSE is a green light with no bulb behind it (trap 34).
    This builds a throwaway git repository in TEMP - never this repo, never the real
    channel files - seeds it with fixture ledgers and a fixture baseline table, and then
    does each forbidden thing on purpose.

    Twenty-five cases, and fifteen of them are "must PASS". That ratio is not padding. A size
    ratchet's whole risk is the false positive: it sits in front of files that 40% of this
    repo's commits touch, and the single most likely way for it to be wrong is to refuse an
    append that policy allows. So the passes carry the same weight as the refusals, and each
    one corresponds to a real shape this repo produces - an ordinary append under the limit,
    a rotation, a partly-finished rotation, a 2 MB archive write, a pull request that never
    touched the file at all.

    CASES 20-24 ARE THE WARN BAND (DRA-284, carrying Helm's DRA-282 Q1 ruling). They exist
    because a warning nobody has watched FIRE is trap 34 in its purest form: the WARN
    changes no exit code, so every other case in this file would stay green if the band
    silently stopped matching anything, and the guard would go on printing "ok" while the
    trigger `CLAUDE.md` line 104 promises - "a headroom WARN is the trigger to rotate" - did
    nothing. Case 23 is the one that earns its keep: it builds a real append history so the
    `3 x median append` term is live, and asserts a WARN at 10,536 B of headroom, which is
    eight times the 2% floor. A guard that shipped only the percentage arm passes cases 20-22
    and fails 23 - and shipping only the percentage arm is precisely what DRA-284's done bar
    warns against, because 2% of 65,536 is 1,311 B and no Helm-class ledger is ever that
    close to its cap for more than one append.

    THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST IS CASE 7: a pull request that does not touch HELM.md, on a
    tree where HELM.md is already 14x over the limit. On a `pull_request` run the checkout
    is the merge result, so every oversized ledger in the repo is sitting in head whether
    this author wrote a byte of it or not. A guard that read head alone would fail every
    pull request in the repository on its first day and call it enforcement.

    CASE 2 IS THE TRAP-74 CASE. It asserts the exact counts the guard prints, because every
    refusal below would still "pass" if the roster silently stopped matching any file: a
    guard measuring nothing refuses nothing. The mojibake list in channel-wipe-guard.ps1 was
    green for a month while matching nothing, and a printed count is what exposed it.

    CASE 1 EARNED ITS KEEP IMMEDIATELY. Every arm fires on `head > base`, so any asymmetry
    in how the two sides are read is indistinguishable from growth - and on this suite's
    first run the guard refused an untouched tree, because reconstructing a blob from git's
    output drops the trailing newline that a working-tree read keeps. One byte, on every
    file, forever. That bug does not survive a threshold-free comparison and it would not
    have been found by any of the nineteen cases aimed at the arms themselves.

    CASES 16-19 are the baseline table's own integrity - raise a row, add a row, keep a
    discharged row, roster an unknown one. A ratchet whose ceiling the ratcheted party can
    edit is a suggestion, and those four are what make the table's numbers only ever fall.
