.SYNOPSIS
    Release or abandon a Soft seat claim. Recover a dead holder with -ForceStale.

.DESCRIPTION
    Experiment A' on EQBuddy (the lab) — not a Corps standard. Own-seat release
    is always allowed. Releasing someone else's claim requires -ForceStale AND
    (age ≥ -StaleAfterHours, default SoftSeatStaleAfterHours = 8 h, OR a recorded
    pid that is no longer running). A missing pid does not count as dead — only
    age does.

    This is the ONLY recovery from the DRA-76 refusal, and the widened rule made
    it load-bearing: a challenger or disjoint seat now holds the item too, so a
    default claim waits on someone releasing — or on -ForceStale proving the
    holder is gone.

    Does not write HANDOFF.md or HELM-FEEDBACK.md. Does not touch scheduled_tasks.lock or the
    screen lock. Local store only (see scripts/soft-seat-store.ps1) — and since
    DRA-102 that is a deliberate half of union-READ / local-WRITE: this script
    never abandons a row in another clone's store, it NAMES it and the command
    that would, in the clone that owns it.

    -WorkItem is NOT key-checked here, unlike claim-seat.ps1. Claims recorded
    before DRA-50 carry bare issue numbers, and refusing to release them would
    strand every one of them behind a rule they predate.

    INVOKE THIS SCRIPT RESOLVED, through the clone's MAIN checkout (DRA-107,
    Helm-signed 2026-09-16) — the same rule as claim-seat.ps1, for the same
    reason: a linked worktree carries its OWN, possibly stale, copy of this file,
    and the bare relative path runs that copy. --git-common-dir answers the
    clone's .git from a linked worktree and from the main checkout alike, so one
    invocation is right everywhere. Needs git >= 2.31 for --path-format=absolute.
    The bare relative form still works and is DEMOTED, not removed.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/release-seat.ps1" -WorkItem DRA-28 -SeatId opus-isolation
    pwsh -NoProfile -File "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/release-seat.ps1" -WorkItem DRA-28 -ForceStale
