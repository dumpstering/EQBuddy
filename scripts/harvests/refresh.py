"""Knowledge refresh — the cadence that keeps embedded catalogs in step with
eqlwiki.com as the community edits it.

Why this exists: EQBuddy ships wiki-derived catalogs (quests, fade messages,
zone graph) as embedded data, and the wiki is no longer static — the in-app
"Copy for wiki" flow (discussion #65) has players actively pushing loot/spawn
observations to it. This script turns "someone remembers to re-run the
harvesters" into a scheduled, reviewable loop.

What one run does:
  1. asks the wiki's MediaWiki API for changes since the last run
     (refresh-state.json; recentchanges is a handful of requests)
  2. evicts exactly the changed pages from the harvest caches and drops the
     title-list caches so NEW pages get enumerated
  3. re-runs the harvesters — their resume-safe cache discipline means work is
     proportional to what actually changed, not catalog size
  4. re-runs the deterministic promotions:
       spells.json  -> FadeMessages.json   (fades-harvest.py)
       spells.json  -> SlowSpells.json     (slows-harvest.py)
       spells.json  -> BuffDurations.json  (buffs-harvest.py)
       spells.json  -> DebuffLandings.json (debuffs-harvest.py)
       spells.json  -> CharmSpells.json    (charms-harvest.py)
       spells.json  -> SpellLevels.json    (spell-levels-promote.py)
       class pages  -> SpellLevels.json    (class-spells-harvest.py, then the promote:
                                            the CLASS page wins and the spell pages fill
                                            only levels it has no section for)
       quests.json  -> QuestCatalog.json   (quests-promote.py)
       quest wikitext + QuestCatalog.json
                    -> HarvestedGuides.json.gz (guides-transform.py; AUTO-written guides,
                       one per catalog quest that has anything to say. GuideCatalog.json
                       stays curated and wins on questName — see that script's header)
       zones.json   -> ZoneGraph.json      (../eqltools/zones-merge.py; the
                       eqltools half is a committed extract — browser-fetched,
                       see ../eqltools/README.md — and stays as-is)
       zone wikitext -> ZoneLevelBands.json / ZoneMerchants.json / ZoneEras.json
                       (zonelevels-, merchants-, zone-eras-transform.py; fetch nothing)
     The first four are order-sensitive: the exact-match catalogs partition the
     message space, and each later one excludes lines the earlier ones claimed
     (fades exclude landing lines, buffs exclude fade/slow/regen claims,
     debuffs exclude everything the other three took). Issue #167 found the
     gap this closes: 170 new alchemy potion/spell pages landed on the wiki
     and no scheduled run would ever have carried them into BuffDurations.
  5. flags CURATED catalogs whose source pages changed (SpawnCatalog, AaCatalog,
     MezSpells, CcSpells, RegenSpells, GuideCatalog) — those carry human judgment
     and are never auto-written; the flag goes in the report for a person to act on
  6. writes eqlwiki/refresh-report.md and updates eqlwiki/refresh-state.json

Run it by hand any time, or let .github/workflows/knowledge-refresh.yml run it
weekly and open a PR with the report as its body. Exit code 0 always (no
changes is success); the workflow decides "PR or not" from git status.

Politeness contract (same as every harvester here): ~1 request/second,
identified User-Agent, exponential backoff. A refresh with no wiki changes
costs ~2 API requests total.
