"""Build the fourteen Epic 1.0 guides into the curated guide catalog (DRA-41, Delivery 3).

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
`GuideCatalog.json` is CURATED and never auto-written — the weekly refresh may FLAG a guide
whose source page moved, it may not rewrite one. This script does not break that rule, and the
distinction is worth stating plainly because it is the whole safety argument:

  * It never fetches. Nothing here touches eqlwiki.
  * Its input is `EpicQuestChecklist.json`, which is itself CURATED — a human transcribed each
    class's `== Checklist ==` into ordered, sectioned rows, and every box a player has ticked
    is keyed to those row ids.
  * It is a RESHAPE, not a harvest: row -> objective, section -> stage, and the row's text
    carried across verbatim as a `Transcribed` step's WHAT. No field is derived from prose, no
    prerequisite is invented, no reward is chosen.

So it is run BY A PERSON, once, as part of an authoring PR — the way you would run a rename
across 486 rows rather than doing it by hand and getting three of them wrong. It is committed
because a reviewer has to be able to check the 486 rows arrived unaltered, and reading a
diff is not that check; re-running this and finding the file unchanged is.

BYTE-REPRODUCIBLE
-----------------
Rewrites the whole catalog with the formatting it already has (UTF-8, 2-space indent,
trailing newline), so the 95 Plane of Sky guides round-trip with a zero-byte diff and the only
change in `git diff` is the fourteen guides this adds. Run it twice: the second run changes
nothing. `EpicGuideDataTests` asserts the shape of the result from the other side.

LINE ENDINGS ARE THE CHECKOUT'S, NOT THE CLAIM (DRA-642, trap 74). The blob is LF in git; a
Windows checkout with `core.autocrlf=true` (CI's windows-latest) hands this CRLF, one with
`core.autocrlf=false` hands it LF. A raw byte comparison asserted which git config made the
checkout, so `--check` was red on every LF clone over identical contents. Both sides are
compared with line endings folded, and a write keeps whichever ending the file on disk has.

    python scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/epic-guides-build.py [--check]

`--check` writes nothing and exits 1 if the file on disk is not what this would produce — the
form for CI or for a reviewer who wants the assertion without the write.
