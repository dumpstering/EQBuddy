.SYNOPSIS
    EQBuddy Evolved (2.x) develops LOCAL-ONLY, and that has to be a mechanism.

.DESCRIPTION
    The owner's GO for Evolved (2026-09-04) says: no public channel, no auto-publish,
    until he says ready. Today that promise has a hole big enough to drive a release
    through, and it is not the one anybody watches:

      `release.ps1` copies EQBuddySetup.exe, its .sha256 and the portable zip into
      C:\Users\david\OneDrive\EQBuddyDownload on EVERY run - before the `if ($Tag)`
      block, with or without a tag, with or without -Prerelease. `UpdateChecker` is
      local-first BY DESIGN: `Check(folder)` reads that exe's FileVersionInfo,
      `IsNewer` compares it to the running build, `FindBestAsync` returns it as "a
      local file ready to install as-is", and the widget asks at startup and every six
      hours. So one release.ps1 run on a 2.x tree auto-updates every family v1 install
      to a Windows-only Evolved build inside six hours - no tag, no GitHub release, no
      prerelease flag anywhere in the story.

    `-Prerelease` (#279) closed the OTHER hole, the GitHub one. release.ps1's own
    comment says so in as many words: *"The OneDrive copy above is a SEPARATE channel
    ... so a prerelease still reaches the family's widgets."* Correct and deliberate for
    v1. It is the leak for Evolved.

    THE POSTURE: local-only is enforced structurally or it is not enforced. This repo
    already knows the shape - release.ps1 has no -SkipSign on purpose, because a
    protection you can pass a flag to opt out of is a protection nobody has. So with the
    script as written you cannot publish a 2.x build at all; opening the channel is a
    deliberate future EDIT, made when the owner gives the channel go.

    Four checks, all at major >= 2 only (this is a no-op on the 1.x line, which is
    finished and lives on `legacy-v1`):

      1. Every statement in release.ps1 that reaches the family - the OneDrive copy, the
         local /SILENT install, `gh release create` - lives inside ONE region opened by
         `if (-not $EvolvedLocal) {`, and the 2.x refusal (throw unless -EvolvedLocal)
         is positioned BEFORE that region and before the 172 MB publish. A future edit
         that re-adds a copy outside the region fails the build rather than the family's
         widgets. In LogJanitorPolicyTests' shape: the guard reads the script text.

         Since 2026-09-05 that list had a fourth member which reached NOBODY and was on it
         anyway: compiling, signing or hashing EQBuddySetup.exe. The other three are about
         a file leaving the machine; the installer only had to EXIST. It carried v1's
         AppId and {autopf}\EQBuddy, so a signed 2.0.0 one sitting in dist\ was one
         double-click from replacing the v1 install and inheriting its profile - and
         check 3 watches the family's update folder, never dist\.

         ON 2026-09-07 (TR-2, FABLE.md §3, signed #399) THAT MEMBER FLIPPED: from "never
         build the installer" to "only ever build it under the NEW IDENTITY". The
         mitigation was never the point - the AppId was. installer\EQBuddyEvolved.iss has
         its own AppId, installs into {autopf}\EQBuddy Evolved with its own Start-menu
         entry, and is named EQBuddyEvolvedSetup.exe, so the artifact cannot do the thing
         "build none" was avoiding. Check 5 below is the flipped row, and it is TWO facts
         that must both hold: the reserved name is never produced anywhere on a 2.x tree,
         and the script that IS compiled carries the Evolved identity. A negative alone
         would pass on a tree that builds no installer at all, which is trap 34's shape -
         so the positive is asserted beside it.
      2. `gh release create` is unreachable on a 2.x tree, by two independent locks -
         it is inside the region above, and -EvolvedLocal refuses -Tag and -Prerelease
         outright. There is deliberately NO switch that re-enables it.
      3. THE POSITIVE ONE, and the only one that is about the world: the live update
         folder contains no EQBuddySetup.exe stamped 2.x. Checks 1 and 2 prove a script;
         trap 43's lesson is that proving the producer is not proving the effect. If a
         2.x setup is sitting in that folder, every family widget is six hours from
         installing it and no amount of correct script text helps.

      4. CLOSED 2026-09-04 (E-2c), and it used to be this file's named RESIDUAL: no
         workflow under .github/workflows/ fires on a `release:` event. The residual was
         `release-assets.yml`, which attached non-Windows assets on `release: published` -
         unreachable through release.ps1, since checks 1 and 2 make the release itself
         unreachable, but a release made BY HAND in the GitHub UI would still have
         triggered it, and then the first Evolved release ever published would have
         carried Linux and macOS artifacts of a Windows-only product.

         E-2c deletes that workflow from the Evolved mainline; this check is what keeps
         it deleted. Legacy tags keep their own copy of it in their own tree and can be
         re-published forever, which is LEGACY-004 - `release-assets.yml` runs from the
         TAG's tree, not from main, which is the observation that made deleting it safe.

         Same shape as check 1's fourth token: deleting the thing without guarding the
         shape leaves the mechanism exactly as blind as it was.

      5. THE INSTALLER IDENTITY (TR-2, 2026-09-07), which is check 1's fourth member after
         the flip described above, and is stated as its own check because it reads two
         files rather than one region:

           * EQBuddySetup.exe is a RESERVED NAME belonging to the v1 line FOREVER. Every
             deployed 1.x updater matches on it (UpdateChecker.SetupName) and the v1
             contract is frozen - an asset of that name on a 2.x release would be
             downloaded and run by every Windows v1 install's existing update flow, a
             major-line replacement with no consent moment. So no 2.x path may PRODUCE
             one: not release.ps1, not install-local.ps1, and not a .iss sitting in the
             tree that anyone could hand-compile. Reading the name is fine and is the
             point - release.ps1 still warns about a pre-TR-2 leftover in dist\.
           * The installer script release.ps1 compiles is the Evolved one, and carries all
             four halves of the identity: the new AppId (and NOT v1's), the
             {autopf}\EQBuddy Evolved directory, its own Start-menu group, and the
             EQBuddyEvolvedSetup output name.

         The AppId literals are written HERE as well as in the .iss on purpose: this is
         the ScreenLockTests shape - two files that must agree, neither with a compiler
         that can see the other. The v1 literal is carried as the thing that must never
         come back.

    Exits non-zero on a violation. The tree is 1.99.x until E-1's third commit lands, so
    -AssumeVersion exists purely so this can be PROVEN to fail before it can ever fire
    (traps 34, 39: a guard that has never failed has not been shown to guard anything).
    -Repo points it at another worktree; -AssumeUpdateFolder is check 3's own prove-fail
    hook, since the real folder is - and had better stay - clean.

    Files are read with [IO.File]::ReadAllText rather than Get-Content: Windows
    PowerShell 5.1 decodes with the ANSI code page and this repo's scripts are full of
    em dashes (trap 54, and the same reason legacy-notice-guard.ps1 does it).
