.SYNOPSIS
    A pull request may not grow an active channel ledger past 64 KiB. The remedy is
    ROTATION into the archive - never deletion.

.DESCRIPTION
    DRA-73 plan rev 2 (approved by David 2026-09-14) set a 30-day / ~64 KB rotation policy
    for the channel ledgers and named a CI size ratchet to enforce the size arm. The
    rotation shipped under DRA-75; the ratchet did not, and DRA-73 then closed, so the
    check had no live owner. This is it (DRA-26 plan rev 3 section 7, card A).

    The gap it fills is measured, not theoretical. On `main` at 275cc215, 9 of the 11
    rostered channel files are over the approved limit - HELM.md by 14x (942 KB),
    DECISIONS.md by 9x (615 KB), BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md by 8x (502 KB) - and nothing in
    `.github/workflows/ci.yml` looked at the size of any of them. `channel-wipe-guard.ps1`
    forbids a ledger getting SMALLER by the wrong mechanism. Nothing forbade it getting
    bigger without limit, which is the failure mode that actually happens every day: an
    agent that conscientiously reads the channel files burns ~300K tokens before writing a
    line of code (DRA-73 section 1.4).

    TWO ARMS, and which one applies is decided by the file's size AT BASE:

      CEILING   base <= 64 KiB. Head may not exceed 64 KiB. No tolerance, no grandfather,
                nothing to argue about - this is the acceptance criterion in one line, and
                it is what governs every file once DRA-144's rotation lands.
      RATCHET   base > 64 KiB. The file is already in debt, so it is judged against its
                recorded row in `channel-size-baseline.psd1` plus 10%. An over-limit file
                with NO row may not grow at all.

    BOTH ARMS FIRE ONLY WHEN THIS PULL REQUEST GREW THE FILE (head > base). That is
    deliberate and it is the word the card uses - "fails any PR that GROWS an active
    channel ledger beyond 64 KB". A pull request that never touched HELM.md must not be
    failed for HELM.md: on a `pull_request` run the checkout is the merge result, so every
    ledger's ambient size is in head whether the author wrote it or not, and blaming an
    author for the state of the branch they merged into is how a guard earns a reputation
    for firing on Tuesday. It also keeps the one move the policy WANTS - rotation, which
    shrinks a file - green by construction rather than by exemption.

    WHAT "GREW" CAN STILL OVER-COUNT, and it is worth knowing before the first surprise.
    On a `pull_request` run head is the merge result against the CURRENT base tip, while
    `-BaseRef` is the base sha the pull request was opened against, so any growth main
    accumulated in between sits inside head and is attributed to this pull request.
    `channel-wipe-guard.ps1` compares the same two points and has the same property; two
    gates on one policy disagreeing about what "base" means would be worse than the
    over-count. In practice the grandfather band is what absorbs it - HELM.md takes ~13 KB
    per append, so the 10% band is about seven of them - and when the band is genuinely
    exhausted, every open pull request going red until the file is rotated is the ratchet
    working rather than a bug in it. That is the whole mechanism: the pressure lands on the
    repository, not on one unlucky author.

    THE ARCHIVE IS NEVER MEASURED. The roster is twelve files at the repo ROOT; nothing
    under `docs/ops/claude-archive/` is a rostered path, so a rotation that moves 900 KB
    out of a ledger and into the archive is a shrink plus an untouched-by-this-guard write.
    That is structural rather than an exemption clause, which matters: an exemption can be
    argued into covering something else, and a path that is simply not in the roster cannot.
    `channel-size-selftest.ps1` asserts it anyway - a 2 MB archive write, and a full
    900 KB -> 40 KB rotation, both green - because "it cannot happen" is how the mojibake
    list stayed green for a month while matching nothing (trap 74).

    IT MEASURES LF-NORMALISED UTF-8 BYTES, NOT FILE LENGTH, and that is not fastidiousness.
    This repo has no `.gitattributes` and the Windows checkout runs `core.autocrlf=true`, so
    every blob is LF in git and CRLF on disk. Comparing a working-tree read against a base
    blob would have reported 3,054 bytes of growth on HELM.md - one per line, written by
    nobody. Normalising both sides is what makes the number the same on a developer's
    machine, in `check.ps1`, and on the runner.

    THE BASELINE TABLE IS CHECKED, NOT TRUSTED. A ratchet whose ceiling the ratcheted party
    can raise is a suggestion. So: a row may not be RAISED, a row may not be ADDED, a row
    for an unrostered path fails, and a row whose file this pull request brought under the
    limit must be DELETED in that same pull request - the rule docs/Architecture.md's
    hotspot table states as "the lift came first, and the baseline came down in the same
    commit". Rows only ever leave.

    AND THE ROSTER IS CHECKED TOO. Every `*-FEEDBACK.md` at the repo root must be rostered.
    A hand-written list stops covering the repo the day the repo grows, and the file it
    stops covering is the one nobody is looking at (trap 30; docs/Architecture.md says the
    same thing about the hotspot list, having learned it from a 5,127-line file that had no
    ratchet at all).

    THERE IS NO -Force AND NO SKIP SWITCH, for the reason `channel-wipe-guard.ps1` has
    none, and there is no parameter that supplies the baseline table either. It is read
    from the tree at head like any other tracked file, so the only way to change what the
    ratchet allows is to edit a committed file that the four rules above are watching -
    which is a reviewable diff rather than a command-line argument. `-Repo`, `-BaseRef` and
    `-HeadRef` exist for one reason: `channel-size-selftest.ps1` uses them to drive every
    arm of this guard into the red on a throwaway repo. Green-only is vacuous coverage
    (trap 34).

    AND SINCE DRA-284 IT WARNS BEFORE IT REFUSES. Until then this guard was binary - exit 1
    with a reason, or exit 0 with a count - and `CLAUDE.md` line 104 states a trigger it did
    not emit: "a headroom WARN is the trigger to ROTATE, never to buy room". No seat could
    act on that, because nothing told it the band was thin. Helm ruled the band on
    2026-09-21 (DRA-282 Q1, tip PR #773), amending the live DRA-232 (a) re-pin in the same
    commit:

        "Default: WARN when remaining band is 2% of ceiling or THREE median appends,
         whichever is larger; the rotate seat claims before the file is red."

    So per measured file: remaining = <its governing cap> - <head bytes>, and it WARNS when
    that is at or under max(2% of 65,536 = 1,311 B, 3 x this file's median append). The
    governing cap is whichever arm above actually governs the file - the 64 KiB ceiling, or
    a grandfathered row plus 10%, or, for a file over the limit with no row, its own base
    size, because that is genuinely all the room it has. One arithmetic, read off the arm
    that would produce the red, so the warning and the refusal can never disagree.

    A WARN NEVER CHANGES AN EXIT CODE and never edits a message either arm prints. That is
    the ruling's own shape - a claim signal for the rotate seat, not a second gate - and
    DRA-284's bar says it in one line: "a WARN never changes an exit code". A file that is
    ALREADY red this run is not also warned; the red says more, and printing both is two
    places to fix one sentence.

    IT WARNS ON THE WHOLE ROSTER, NOT ON ARM (a) ONLY. The ruling defines the band inside
    arm (a) and DRA-282 fenced "LEAVE inventing moving files between arms", so this is worth
    being explicit about: a WARN is not a rotation arm and assigns none. This guard has
    never carried arm membership - `$Roster` is twelve files and the comment on it says so -
    and arm membership moves under it (DRA-287 moved `FABLE.md` from (a) to (c) two days
    before this shipped). Teaching the guard a second, slower-moving copy of that list is
    how the roster and the arms drift apart, and the file nobody is looking at is the one
    that drifted. Every rostered file has a cap and a band; every rostered file gets the
    same arithmetic.

    THE MEDIAN APPEND IS MEASURED PER FILE FROM THAT FILE'S OWN HISTORY, which is the only
    source here that stays true without anybody maintaining it. It is the median of the
    POSITIVE size deltas between consecutive revisions of the path over the last
    $AppendWindow of them, read from git as blob sizes - the same LF unit the arms measure,
    since git stores blobs LF-normalised under this repo's `core.autocrlf=true`. Reproduce
    any number this prints with:

        git log --format=%H -n 21 HEAD -- HELM.md | ForEach-Object { git cat-file -s "${_}:HELM.md" }

    - successive differences, keep the positive ones, take the middle. Three properties are
    deliberate. (1) POSITIVE deltas only: a rotation is a large negative delta and it is not
    an append, so it is dropped rather than dragging the median under zero. (2) A BOUNDED
    WINDOW of 20 deltas rather than the file's whole life, because the append REGIME changes
    - Helm's (d) short-tip ruling and the DRA-154 rotation both moved HELM.md's entry size,
    and a lifetime median would answer a question about last month. The window is the only
    number here this repo chose; the band itself (2%, and N=3) is Helm's. (3) NO INVENTED
    FALLBACK: a file with too little history to have a median - a new file, a fixture repo,
    a shallow clone - is judged on the 2% term alone and says so in a note. A stated
    constant would be a number nobody approved sitting in the one place the band is decided.

    Note that 2% of 65,536 is 1,311 B while every Helm-class ledger's median append is
    thousands, so `3 x median` is the binding term in practice and the percentage is a floor
    for the quiet files. A guard that shipped only the percentage arm would be a WARN that
    never fires, which is trap 34 wearing a new hat.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never trims, moves or edits a ledger, and it does not touch
    `scripts/channel-wipe-guard.ps1` - that guard hard-codes the archive root this policy
    rotates into, and editing it from inside the change it polices is trap 52. It adds,
    raises and removes no baseline row - DRA-282 restated DRA-232's refusal of per-file
    ceilings as "a self-granted exemption, and check B already refuses it" - and the WARN is
    emphatically not a way to buy room, it is the trigger to rotate.

#   CRLF   This repo has no `.gitattributes` and the Windows checkout runs
#          `core.autocrlf=true`, so every blob is LF in git and CRLF on disk. Measured on
#          HELM.md at 6fdfb916: the working-tree read is 780,701 bytes against the blob's
#          777,647. That is 3,054 bytes of "growth", which is exactly the line count.
