# no installer AT ALL. The reason was not publishing - the region below already stops that
# - it was that the installer only had to EXIST: installer\EQBuddy.iss carried v1's AppId
# and {autopf}\EQBuddy, so a signed 2.0.0 EQBuddySetup.exe sitting in dist\ was ONE
# double-click from replacing this machine's v1 install in place and inheriting its
# profile (settings.json, history.db, archives), with #158's rollback giving back the
# binary and not the profile. Nothing watches dist\: evolved-channel-guard's check 3
# scans the family's update folder.
#
# TR-2 (FABLE.md §3, signed #399) replaces that mitigation with an IDENTITY, which is the
# stronger form of the same protection: installer\EQBuddyEvolved.iss has its own AppId,
# installs into {autopf}\EQBuddy Evolved and its own Start-menu entry, and is named
# EQBuddyEvolvedSetup.exe - because EQBuddySetup.exe is a RESERVED NAME belonging to the
# v1 line forever (every deployed 1.x updater matches on it; the contract is frozen).
# So the artifact this builds cannot do the thing "never build one" was avoiding, and
# double-clicking it installs BESIDE v1 rather than over it.
#
# Signing is unchanged and unconditional, here as everywhere: an unsigned local build is
# testing a different artifact from the one players get.
#
# One variable, because the artifact's name is one fact and the channel region below
# names it three more times (trap 4). Changing it here changes it everywhere.

    # where no fix of ours can reach them. Charter RELEASE-002 asks for exactly this posture
    # during v2 construction (docs/v2, #275 / P0-1).

    #  * It is not the only belt. `ParseRelease` runs `Version.TryParse` on the tag and
    #    returns null when it fails, so a tag shaped `v2.0.0-beta1` offers nothing even if it
    #    were marked latest. Belt, not replacement: a `v2.0.0` tag parses fine.
