.SYNOPSIS
    A pull request may not empty, truncate or wholesale-replace a channel ledger.

.DESCRIPTION
    Three times in six days a channel file was destroyed by a commit whose message said
    it was signing something:

      7b804338  2026-09-04  HELM-FEEDBACK.md  2713 -> 2209 lines ("restore + clean edit")
      24a91e64  2026-09-09  HELM.md and HELM-FEEDBACK.md DELETED (PR #493)
      d20c8e07  2026-09-10  HELM.md and HELM-FEEDBACK.md DELETED again (empty-tree amend)

    Both deletions were repaired by a follow-up restore commit, so `main` today looks
    fine and the history says otherwise. CLAUDE.md already carries the rule - "APPEND
    your entry; never rewrite the file ... check that `git diff` over the file is
    additions-only" - and trap 60 records that the rule has been broken by three
    different mechanisms. Trap 60(c) ends: "No guard yet; that is a named hole." This is
    the guard. Process language told the agent what to do; it could not tell CI what to
    refuse.

    WHAT IT COMPARES. Base ref versus head (the working tree by default, so a wipe is
    caught before it is even committed). On a pull_request run the checkout is the merge
    result, which is exactly the question worth asking: what would landing this do to the
    ledgers?

    THE ROSTER IS TIERED, because these files are not all the same promise:

      ledger  Append-only records. Nothing is ever taken out of them.
              HELM-FEEDBACK, FABLE-FEEDBACK, BEVEL-FEEDBACK, SCRIBE-FEEDBACK,
              CLAUDE-FEEDBACK, DECISIONS.
      state   HANDOFF.md (and the HELM.md pointer, DRA-569) - holds and posture.
              Holds get LIFTED, so it shrinks legitimately, but only ever by a hold
              at a time.
      inbox   FABLE, BEVEL, SCRIBE, SCRIBE-TESTING. "When you take an item, delete it"
              is the documented workflow, so a drained inbox is correct and a
              percentage check on it would be noise. An inbox gets the wipe check only.

    SIX CHECKS:

      1. WIPE      - a rostered file that exists and has content at base must exist and
                     have content at head. All three incidents fail here, and this check
                     has no threshold to argue about.
      2. SHRINK    - ledger/state: head keeps at least 60% of base's substantive lines.
      3. REPLACE   - ledger/state, and it has TWO ARMS, because the two ask different
                     questions about the same rewrite:

                     3a. LINE retention - at least 65% of base's substantive lines are
                         still PRESENT at head (multiset). Sensitive to any rewrite,
                         which is its strength and also why it needs the REPAIR
                         exemption below: re-encoding a file moves every line that
                         carries a dash without losing a word of it.
                     3b. ENTRY retention - at least 85% of base's ENTRY HEADINGS are
                         still present at head, compared through a key with all
                         non-ASCII STRIPPED, whitespace collapsed and case FOLDED.

                     3b is the key PR #507 was built around, and the reason it is worth
                     carrying as well as 3a rather than instead of it:

                       - It cannot be moved by encoding churn. `ff6853ba`, an honest
                         "merge main (additions-only KEEP)", re-encoded HELM.md so that
                         E2 80 94 (a UTF-8 em dash) became C3 A2 E2 82 AC E2 80 9D (the
                         same dash through cp1252 - trap 54's shape). Every line
                         carrying a dash compared unequal while saying exactly what it
                         said before. Strip non-ASCII and the entry is the same entry.
                       - Because of that it is NOT excused by the REPAIR exemption, and
                         that closes a real hole in arm 3a alone: a rewrite that removes
                         mojibake at full length is waved through by REPAIR, so a commit
                         that repaired the encoding AND quietly dropped forty entries
                         passed every check. An encoding repair does not move an entry
                         key, so a repair that also loses entries now has nothing left
                         to hide behind. `channel-wipe-guard-selftest.ps1` case 13 is
                         exactly that commit, and it is green on arm 3a.
                       - A ledger's unit is the ENTRY - "APPEND your entry" - so losing
                         one is the harm being named, and a percentage of entries is a
                         number a human can argue with in review.

                     Entries are found ANYWHERE, not only at the start of a line, and
                     the key is capped at 80 characters. Both are forced by the state of
                     the file this guard exists for: `c7a597a8` collapsed
                     HELM-FEEDBACK.md's 8,677 lines into 2, so `origin/main` today has
                     EIGHT line-start headings standing for 1,051 entries. A line-start
                     reading would have given this arm no coverage at all on the one
                     ledger that has been destroyed twice - a detector aimed at nothing
                     (trap 74). Scanning mid-line recovers 3,523 of them. The cap keeps
                     a recovered key from swallowing its entry's whole body, so an edit
                     inside an entry is not read as the loss of it.

      4. MOJIBAKE  - no rostered file may gain double-encoded characters, counted as
                     SEQUENCES by a cp1252 reversibility test plus a short list for the
                     two codecs a round trip cannot express (trap 60(b): a whole-file
                     rewrite through the wrong codec). Base-relative, so existing damage
                     is not re-litigated on every PR - only NEW damage fails.
                     Measured 2026-09-21, after DRA-244 widened it: the live roster holds
                     14 across three files - HELM.md 9, FABLE.md 3, FABLE-FEEDBACK.md 2 -
                     and the twelve in HELM.md and FABLE.md are the ones only the widened
                     arm can see. The nine 2026-Q3 archive mirrors hold 91,123, 82,883 of
                     them in HELM-FEEDBACK.md. The archive is NOT rostered and is not
                     checked here; DRA-254 holds whether any of it is worth repairing.
      5. ROSTER    - every `*-FEEDBACK.md` at the repo root is in the roster above.
                     Trap 34: a guard that forbids the wrong thing cannot see a missing
                     thing, and an unrostered channel file is one nobody is protecting.
      6. SHELL-STDERR / BOM - a rostered channel file's first line must not carry a
                     shell's STDERR (DRA-268's exact defect: `bash.exe: warning: could
                     not find /tmp, please create!` landed on main at blob 85a22a63 -
                     stderr captured into a ledger, trap 60's write path one step over
                     from the mojibake rewrite) nor a UTF-8 BOM (U+FEFF, DRA-268's
                     second anomaly). Both are BASE-RELATIVE in the mojibake shape:
                     a repair that REMOVES an already-present line-1 artifact passes
                     (that is the DRA-268 fix itself, which must land green), and a
                     commit that ADDS one - to a file that did not have one - is
                     refused.

    WHERE THE NUMBERS CAME FROM. Every revision of every rostered file in this repo's
    history was measured (1,379 of them) before the thresholds were chosen, because a
    threshold nobody calibrated is a threshold that fires on Tuesday:

      ledger/state, size:       only 5 revisions ever fell below 98% of base, and only
                                the 4 wipe revisions below 60%. Worst legitimate value
                                in the whole history is 90.7% (91fab9a0, a hold lift on
                                a 75-line HELM.md). The floor is 60%.
      ledger/state, retention:  35 revisions below 90%. Every one of them is a wipe, the
                                2026-09-04 truncation, or a mojibake rewrite - there is
                                no clean commit down there. Worst clean value is 84.5%.
                                The floor is 65%, which leaves the two nearest clean
                                revisions (66.7%, 68.7% - both mojibake) failing for the
                                right reason and every clean one passing.
      ENTRY retention:          measured the same way, over all 1,143 ledger/state
                                revision pairs with at least four entries at base. The
                                separation is cleaner than any line measure in this file:

                                  ledger  n=909. Three revisions below 90%, and all
                                          three are the incidents - 24a91e64 (0.000,
                                          PR #493), 7b804338 (0.485, the truncation),
                                          c7a597a8 (0.594, the line collapse). The
                                          worst CLEAN value in the whole history is
                                          0.941 (de05c512, 17 entries).
                                  state   n=234. One revision below 90%: the deletion,
                                          at 0.000. Worst clean is 0.944 (3e68e2a0, a
                                          shipped-and-closed loop on an 18-entry file).
                                  inbox   n=314, min 0.125, fifteen clean revisions
                                          below 90% - a drained inbox again. No entry
                                          check on that tier either, for the same
                                          reason there is no line check.

                                The floor is 85% for both checked tiers: about six
                                points under the worst clean revision ever recorded and
                                thirty-six above the truncation it has to catch.
      inbox:                    9.5% size / 9.1% retention is a NORMAL drained inbox
                                (d091939b). Hence: no percentage check on that tier.

    TWO EXEMPTIONS, because both describe a thing we actually want to happen:

      REPAIR   Un-mangling a file rewrites most of its lines, which is check 3a's exact
               signature. If head has FEWER double-encoded sequences than base and keeps at
               least 95% of its length, the rewrite is a repair and check 3a stands down
               with a note. (It is how e8d2aeed would pass.)

               IT DOES NOT TOUCH 3b, and that asymmetry is the point. The entry key has
               no non-ASCII in it, so a genuine repair moves no entry at all and needs
               no excusing; anything that DID lose entries was not only repairing.
               Waiving 3b here would hand every future rewrite a one-line cover story.
      ARCHIVE  Moving old entries into docs/ops/claude-archive/ is the documented way a
               ledger is allowed to get shorter. If at least 90% of the lines that left
               are found under that directory at head, checks 2 and 3a stand down with a
               note; 3b stands down on the same test applied to the entry keys that
               left. Content that MOVED was not content that was LOST.

    There is no -Force and no skip switch: an escape hatch on a guard whose whole subject
    is "an automated land destroyed the file" is the automated land's next move. The two
    exemptions above are mechanisms, not flags - they are satisfied by doing the right
    thing, not by asserting that you did.

    -Repo and -BaseRef/-HeadRef exist so the guard can be PROVEN to fail:
    scripts/channel-wipe-guard-selftest.ps1 builds throwaway repos and drives each check
    into the red. Green-only is vacuous coverage (trap 34).

    Files are read with [IO.File]::ReadAllText and git output through an explicit UTF-8
    [Console]::OutputEncoding (trap 54) - this repo's docs are full of em dashes, and a
    guard that decodes them through the ANSI code page would report the mojibake it just
    invented.

# Built from code points on purpose: this file must survive being read by a host that
# guesses its encoding, and a literal mojibake glyph in the source is the one string that
# cannot. Each is a UTF-8 sequence that has been decoded through the WRONG CODEC and
# re-encoded. Two codecs are represented, because two different producers did this:
# cp1252 (the Windows ANSI path, DRA-55) and cp437 (the console OEM path, DRA-119).
# EACH ELEMENT IS PARENTHESISED. PowerShell binds `,` TIGHTER than `+`, so the obvious
# spelling - `[char]0xE2 + [char]0x20AC, [char]0xC3 + [char]0xA2` - parses as
# `a + (b, c) + d` and silently collapses the whole list into ONE string of every marker
# joined by $OFS. It matched nothing, and the guard reported a clean file for the exact
# commit that laid down 12,684 markers. A guard that forbids the wrong thing is trap 34;
# a guard that forbids a thing that cannot occur is worse, because it is green.
#
# The cp437 pair is that same lesson at a different table. UTF-8 `E2 80` is the lead of
# every U+2xxx punctuation character (em dash, en dash, curly quotes, ellipsis); read as
# cp437 it becomes U+0393 U+00C7, and read as cp437 a SECOND time it becomes U+256C
# U+00F4. BOTH depths are live in the ledgers, so both are listed - a depth-1-only entry
# scores 0 on the eleven HELM-FEEDBACK.md lines that are corrupt at depth 2 and reports
# them clean, which is the green-with-no-bulb failure one paragraph up, rediscovered.
# Neither pair can occur in honest prose: a Greek capital gamma followed by a C-cedilla,
# and a box-drawing glyph followed by an o-circumflex.
#
# DRA-244 retired the cp1252 ROWS of this list. Enumeration is what produced the gap they
# left: the list carried one U+00C2 pair, U+00A0, and DECISIONS.md at blob `f5036bc5` held
# 481 U+00C2 sequences of which ZERO were that pair - 459 middots (`C2 B7`, the separator
# the decision entries are built out of), 21 section signs, one plus-minus. Its only two
# marker hits on 532 real cp1252 sequences were the two cp437 rows. That is trap 74 again,
# in the same function, one codec over: green while matching nothing.
#
# What is left here is the two codecs a round trip CANNOT express. cp437 is a different
# table, not a wrong-codec read of UTF-8, and U+FFFD is the decode having already given up
# - there are no bytes left to reverse. The cp1252 family moved to Measure-Cp1252Mojibake
# below, which derives the artefact instead of predicting it.

# em dash, an arrow and every character no one has met yet.
#
# The map is built by DECODING all 256 bytes through cp1252 and inverting, never by
# listing characters. That way it agrees by construction with what a cp1252 read of these
# bytes produces, including the five slots cp1252 leaves undefined (0x81 0x8D 0x8F 0x90
