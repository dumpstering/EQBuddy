.SYNOPSIS
    Every gate-evaluated plan carries its keyed `challenge:` line, at the top of its body
    and never inside a slice sequence.

.DESCRIPTION
    DRA-309 S3, off the DRA-305 SPEC (its §5 edit table, §3.2 seam and §7 item 4). The
    Challenger gate fires ONCE, at a plan's SIGN, and the durable record of that walk is a
    keyed line at the top of `docs/plans/DRA-<n>.md`, beside `route:`. This is the guard
    that makes those two sentences checkable instead of believed.

    THE PAIRING IS THE POINT (trap 34). A forbid-scan alone cannot see a plan that quietly
    skipped the gate - "no keyed line in a slice section" is green on a repository with no
    keyed lines at all, which is also what a repository that stopped walking the gate looks
    like. So the forbid-scan below is PAIRED with a curated must-list naming the plans that
    reached the C-test, and the must-list is the half that can see an absence.

    SCOPE IS "EVALUATED", NOT "EVERY PLAN" (merged SPEC §4.1; DRA-306's PROCEED-WITH
    condition; DRA-305 §1.4 item 2). A plan that never reached the C-test writes nothing,
    and this guard demands nothing of it. A guard that required the line universally would
    re-impose precisely the every-card tax that condition removed - so the must-list is
    curated and short by design, and its shortness is not a gap.

    WHAT "KEYED" MEANS, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE DISCRIMINATOR. A keyed line is
    `challenge: <slug> -> <disposition>`, where `<slug>` names the card the walk was about.
    A plan's OWN line is one whose slug is keyed to its OWN card number. That single rule
    is what separates a durable record from prose ABOUT the rule, and the corpus already
    proves it in both directions:

      - `docs/plans/DRA-305.md` §1.3 carries `challenge: dra-304-process-gate -> ...`, a
        real keyed line quoted as evidence about a DIFFERENT card. It must not satisfy
        DRA-305's own must-list row, and it does not, because the key is `dra-304-`.
      - The same file says `challenge:` a dozen times in prose - in §3.1, §5's edit table,
        §6 and §7 - with no keyed slug. None of those is a record of a walk, and none of
        them matches.

    THE VERDICT VOCABULARY IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ. The four SIGNed verdicts are byte-
    frozen in the ops `purpose/CHALLENGER_PROCESS_GATE_SPEC.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` is
    explicit that this repository holds a POINTER to that file and "must never become a
    copy" - for the SPEC's own stated reason, that a copy either tracks the original or
    goes stale, and the stale one is what somebody reads. A guard that enumerated the four
    verdicts here would BE that copy, and it would fail closed on the day the ops repo
    added a fifth. So this guard reads the KEY and the PRESENCE of a disposition; the
    disposition's spelling is the ops SPEC's to own. That is a deliberate limit, not an
    oversight, and it is why a malformed verdict word is a human-review matter.

    THE TWO REGIONS, AND WHY THEY CANNOT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. A plan file is partitioned
    at its first SLICE heading:

      - HEADER  - everything before the first `##`-or-deeper heading. This is "the top of
                  the plan body, beside `route:`" (§5), and it is where a must-list plan's
                  own keyed line is required to be.
      - SLICE   - everything from the first heading that names a slice (`D<n>`, `S<n>`, or
                  a "Slices" section) onward. No keyed line of ANY card may appear here.

    HEADER is a subset of not-SLICE by construction - the header ends at the first heading
    of any kind, and a slice heading is a heading - so a correctly placed line satisfies
    both checks and no file can be caught between them. §3.2 is why the SLICE half exists
    at all: a keyed line on a D(n+1) hand-off is the gate having drifted into the slice
    sequence, which would re-create one layer down the 84% of parked wait that the
    signed-plan-authorizes-every-slice cutover bought out. It is reported as a DEFECT.
