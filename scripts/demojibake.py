"""DRA-55 slice 2 / DRA-119 slice B - repair double-encoded text in the channel ledgers.

Two DIFFERENT defects live in these files, produced by two different code pages.
They need two different inverses, and neither arm can repair the other's damage:

    --mode cp1252   DRA-55.  UTF-8 bytes decoded through cp1252 and re-encoded.
    --mode cp437    DRA-119. UTF-8 bytes decoded through cp437 and re-encoded.

`--mode cp1252` is the default and is byte-for-byte the original DRA-55 tool.

The defect: UTF-8 bytes were decoded through the Windows ANSI code page
(cp1252) and re-encoded as UTF-8, so a correct em dash `E2 80 94` became
`C3 A2 E2 82 AC E2 80 9D`. See DRA-55 for the byte-level proof.

The repair is the inverse of that trip and nothing else:

    text.encode('cp1252') -> the original UTF-8 bytes -> .decode('utf-8')

It is applied PER LINE, and only where the round trip is total: a line is
rewritten only if it re-encodes to cp1252 without loss AND the result decodes
as valid UTF-8 AND the result is actually shorter (a real un-doubling). Any
line that fails any of those is left byte-identical. That is what makes this
safe to run over a file that is only partly corrupt - the intentional mojibake
quotes in BEVEL.md and SCRIBE-FEEDBACK.md are outside the repair set and, even
if they were not, a single-encoded line does not round-trip and is passed
through untouched.

Line splitting is on b'\n' over BYTES and the terminators are preserved, so a
file with CRLF, a missing final newline, or a lone CR inside a line comes out
with the same line structure it went in with.

Usage:
    demojibake.py --check  FILE...   report per-file marker/repair counts, write nothing
    demojibake.py --write  FILE...   repair in place
    demojibake.py --selftest         prove the round trip on built-in vectors

    ... any of the above with `--mode cp437` to run DRA-119's arm instead.

# DRA-119 - the cp437 arm
# ======================================================================================
#
# Same shape of damage, different table: UTF-8 bytes decoded through cp437 and
# re-encoded. An em dash `E2 80 94` becomes U+0393 U+00C7 U+00F6, and that form
# put through the trip a SECOND time becomes U+256C U+00F4 U+251C U+00E7 U+251C
# U+2562. Both depths are live in the ledgers, so this arm iterates to a fixed
# point exactly as the cp1252 arm does.
#
# The inverse is the cp437 codec itself - a TABLE, not a special case for the em
# dash. 68 of the 69 depth-1 lines carry a dash, but HELM-FEEDBACK.md:874 carries
# a section sign (U+252C U+00BA -> U+00A7) and a dash-only rule leaves it corrupt
# while reporting success.
#
# Three things this arm does that the cp1252 arm does not, each one load-bearing:
#
# 1. It repairs maximal NON-ASCII RUNS, not whole lines. Whole-line was the first
#    design and it silently skipped BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md:1117 - a line holding 20
#    corrupt strings - because one unrelated character elsewhere on the line has
#    no cp437 spelling at all, so the whole line failed to encode.
#
# 2. Every byte of an inverted run must be >= 0x80. U+00A7 is legitimately IN
#    cp437, at byte 0x15, so it re-encodes happily and SHRINKS - which is exactly
#    what the cp1252 arm's "a real un-doubling always shrinks" test looks for.
#    Without this check the second pass over :874 would eat the section sign this
#    arm had just correctly restored, and turn it into a control character.
#
# 3. It refuses to touch four enumerated lines. See PRESERVE below.

# The two depth markers, for COUNTING only - the repair itself is driven by the
# round trip, not by these, which is how :874 gets repaired at all. Built from
# bytes for the same reason MARKER is.

# Four of the 81 repairable lines are not damage. They are DRA-75's own report
# text QUOTING both mojibake families as code spans, e.g.
#
#     `<depth-2 form>` and `<depth-1 form>` both appear in 2026-09-12/13 entries
#
# Repairing them collapses both spans to the same em dash and the sentence reads
# "`-` and `-` both appear in" - the evidence these ledgers keep ABOUT this defect,
# silently deleted by the tool that was supposed to be fixing it.
#
# DECISIONS.md is the one that catches people. The sentence wraps across two
# lines and only the first carries the "the corruption is ongoing" tell, so a
# line-local test for "is this line also talking about mojibake" preserves the
# first and repairs the second. Both are listed, by hand, for that reason.
#
# Keys are repo-relative paths, not (basename, line number). Line numbers drift
# on every append, and a basename collides the live ledger with its archive
# copy (DRA-249: the DECISIONS and HELM quotes now live only in
# docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/). Each value is the sha256 of the
# protected line body, hashed the same way as the repair loop (LF-split, trailing
# CR stripped). The line is found by that hash. Appends no longer stale the pin.
#
# This is an ASSERTION, not a filter. A file bound to a key REFUSES TO WRITE
# ANYTHING if either
#
#   - a pin hash is not present exactly once (the line moved to a different file,
#     was duplicated, or the hash is stale), or
#   - the matched line needs no repair (the entry is protecting nothing, which
#     means the list has gone stale and is no longer evidence that anything was
#     skipped).
#
# A filter that silently matches nothing looks exactly like a filter that worked.
# Lookup is exact equality on the repo-relative path. main() resolves every
# argument with Path.resolve().relative_to(repo root) first, so the binding
# follows the file on disk and not the directory the command was run from.
# A basename typed inside the archive directory still matches the archive key.
# A file outside this repo is refused. Suffix matching is intentionally not
# used: a nested notes/FABLE-FEEDBACK.md must not inherit the live ledger's pin.
