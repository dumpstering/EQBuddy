.SYNOPSIS
  ExO execution-model dashboard — DRA-73 plan §6 + §10.3.

.DESCRIPTION
  Computes the §6 metric table over a window of GitHub PRs and emits
  docs/ops/exo-dashboard.md. Dependencies: `gh` and the Paperclip API. Nothing
  else — no modules, no network beyond those two.

  Every metric is computed from data that already exists (PR timestamps, merge
  commits, workflow runs, ruling commits (HELM.md before the 2026-09-30
  cutover, HANDOFF.md from that day; see Get-RulingTouchPaths), the flake ledger, Paperclip issue
  records, the player-report feed). A metric whose data does NOT exist in the
  window is reported as `unmeasured` **with the reason**, never as a zero — an
  unmeasured metric and a measured zero are different claims (trap 64b).

  And the REASON is computed too (DRA-127). A reason printed beside an
  `unmeasured` row is a claim about the window it is printed for; a constant
  sentence is true of at most the window it was written for, and stays printed
  for all the others. Every such sentence here is derived from what this run
  actually read, and the run REFUSES to write a document whose text names a
  precondition the measured window satisfies.

  -Baseline additionally freezes the run into docs/ops/exo-baseline.json, which
  later runs read to fill the "vs baseline" column of the §10.3 "Experiments in
  flight" section. Freezing is the whole point: every later claim about the new
  operating model is checkable against a number that was written down first.

# The player-report feed — escaped defect rate (DRA-127).
#
# The feed is GitHub Discussions on the product repo. That is where player
# reports actually land — 166 of them at the time of writing — and it is the
# only channel this instrument can read without inventing one.
#
# It is also, as read, ILLEGIBLE to a defect count, and the three discussions
# the card named show why: #234 ("Named Monsters in Guk do not appear in
# session") reads as a defect and sits in Q&A, while #237 and #239 are feature
# requests and sit in Ideas. The repo's ten labels are never applied to
# discussions, and the category is the author's guess, not a triage verdict.
#
# A discussion becomes an ESCAPED DEFECT READING only when BOTH halves hold:
#
#   1. it is MARKED as a defect report, and
#   2. the marker NAMES the merge the defect escaped through.
#
# Neither half is decoration. Without (1) the feed is a mixed channel — feature
# requests, quest data, "how do I", and genuine regressions, in one list with no
# labels — and counting it would report ideas as defects. Without (2) a report
# cannot be attributed to a window or a tier at all: an escaped defect is
# reported LATER than the merge that caused it, usually in some other window, so
# "discussions opened during the window" is not the population. The population
# is "reports naming a merge IN the window", and only the marker can say that.
#
# This is why the row is `unmeasured` while the marker is unused, and why that
# is a STRUCTURAL absence rather than a checkpoint that has not arrived: no
# M-milestone marks a discussion. The moment reports carry the marker, the code
# path below computes — including a legitimate measured ZERO, because once the
# feed is legible "no defect escaped this window's merges" is a finding.
#
# DRA-133 / DRA-135 amend the marker and the read in four ways, and each one
# exists to stop the SAME failure: silence printed as a measured zero.
#
#   - The marker is posted as a COMMENT by triage (ruling 1), not written into
#     the player's body, so the read below matches the body OR any comment.
#     Until this landed, a triage sweep would have run, marked, and produced
#     nothing the instrument could see — worse than no sweep, because it would
#     manufacture the belief that the feed is marked.
#   - `unattributed` is an accepted form (ruling 3): "marked, but nobody can
#     name the culprit merge" is a real state, and refusing to represent it
#     means it is recorded as NOT MARKED, which is an undercount.
#   - A window whose merges predate the convention could not have been marked
#     (ruling 4), and a window younger than the report lag floor has a
#     population that has not arrived yet (ruling 6). Both are `unmeasured`
#     with a named reason, never `0`.
$script:DefectMarkerPattern = '(?im)^\s*exo-defect:\s*escaped\s+(?:#(\d+)|(unattributed))\s*$'

# One page is normally the whole feed. The cap exists so that a feed which has
# outgrown it reports TRUNCATED rather than a count that silently omits its own
# tail — an undercount of escaped defects is the one direction that flatters the
# experiment this metric is the stated cost of.
$script:DefectFeedPageSize = 100
$script:DefectFeedPageCap = 20

# The marker now lives in comments, so the comment fetch inherits the same
# discipline: a discussion with an unread comment tail AND no marker in what was
# read is not "unmarked", it is UNREAD, and the whole reading reports Truncated
# rather than a count missing that discussion (ruling 5).
$script:DefectCommentPageSize = 100

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The two guards that stop adoption turning an honest blank into a zero
# (DRA-133 rulings 4 and 6).
#
# `Get-EscapedDefectReading` used to leave `NoConvention` the moment ANY marked
# report existed ANYWHERE in the feed, then divide in-window reports by delivery
# slices. So the first marker ever posted — on any discussion, naming any merge,
# however old — would have flipped every other window from an honest
# `unmeasured` to a measured `0.000`, sourced from silence and printed as
# stated-net-of quality credit for `whole-sequence-auth`. These two constants
# are what make that impossible.

# The date the marking sweep begins. A window whose last merge predates it is
# PERMANENTLY unmeasurable and says so: no backfill (ruling 4), because
# retro-bisecting a three-week-old report is guesswork presented as measurement.
#
# $null was the PLACEHOLDER state and it is deliberately the strictest one: with
# no adopted date, NO window is after the convention, so no window computes.
# The alternative — leaving it unset and permissive — is exactly the trap
# above, reachable by one marker comment posted before the convention has a
# start date to be measured against. Self-test 16b still asserts that state.
#
# ADOPTED 2026-09-26 (DRA-134): the first triage sweep ran that day and covers
# every report created from 00:00Z forward. Windows whose last merge predates it
# — including #580-#607 and #619-#643 — stay unmeasured with that reason.

# Report-lag floor, in days. An escaped defect is reported LATER than the merge
# that caused it, so a window read the day it closes has a population that has
# not arrived. `0/N` in that state is a statement about the calendar.
#
# L = 14 is judgement, not data — there is no marked data yet to set it from.
# Which is why every marked report's observed lag is recorded and reported
# below: L is re-set from that distribution at five marked reports or M2,

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reason honesty (DRA-127).
#
# The defect this exists for: the escaped-defect row printed a hardcoded
# sentence — "the tier model (plan §2.1) did not exist during this window, so no
# merge in it carries a tier. The metric becomes computable for windows after
# M0." That was true of the baseline window #580–#607 and FALSE of every window
# after DRA-74 landed the tier model (PR #608, merge stamp below). It printed
# again unchanged over #619–#643, a window whose PRs do carry tiers, and it
# promised a fix — "computable after M0" — that nothing was going to deliver,
# because the missing thing was never the tier model. A wrong VALUE gets caught
# by the next reader who checks it; a wrong reason for an absent value tells
# that reader not to bother.
#
# A constant sentence may state a STRUCTURAL fact ("no marking convention
# exists"). It may not name a precondition a window can satisfy, because
# nothing re-checks a constant. Each check below is a phrase plus the window
# condition that makes printing it dishonest; the scan runs over the rendered
# document before it is written, so it catches a hardcoded reason anywhere in
# the output, not only the rows this script currently knows about.

    <# The §6 escaped-defect row, as a value that carries its own reason.

       EIGHT worlds now, and they are DIFFERENT CLAIMS — which is the whole of
       DRA-127. `Ok` with a rate of 0 is a measurement ("the feed is legible and
       no marked report names a merge in this window"); `NoConvention` is the
       absence of one ("nothing in the feed says which discussions are defect
       reports, so a count of them would be a count of ideas"). Collapsing those
       two into a bare `unmeasured` with a stock sentence is what let one
       sentence, true of the window it was written for, print unchanged over the
       next one.

       DRA-133 adds three more, and they are the reason this function is not
       just a division. Before them, the reading left `NoConvention` the moment
       ANY marked report existed ANYWHERE in the feed. One marker on one old
       discussion naming one old merge would have turned every other window's
       row into a measured `0.000` — an assertion about merges nobody had
       looked at, printed as quality credit.

         PreConvention — the window's merges predate the marking sweep, so
                         nothing in it COULD have been marked (ruling 4).
         LagFloor      — the window is younger than L days, so its reports have
                         not arrived yet; `0/N` here is about the calendar
                         rather than the code (ruling 6).
         FeedSilent    — no discussion at all has been created since the window
                         closed. A dead feed reading as zero escaped defects is
                         the same lie as an unread one (ruling 6).

       Precedence is deliberate and is ordered by how PERMANENT the reason is,
       not by how the checks happen to be written:

         feed read failure  (nothing about the window is knowable)
         → PreConvention    (permanent; no sweep will ever fix this window)
         → NoConvention     (feed-wide; true until the first marker exists)
         → LagFloor         (window-specific; fixes itself on a known date)
         → FeedSilent       (window-specific; fixes itself if anyone posts)
         → Ok

       NoConvention precedes LagFloor on purpose: when NOTHING in the feed is
       marked, "this window is too young to read" is the less informative of two
       true sentences, and it implies the instrument would otherwise have read
       it. #>
