"""DRA-75 / M0-2 — archive oversized channel files, with a 30-day rotation rule.

Governing plan: DRA-73 plan document rev 2 (approved by David 2026-09-14).
exo-experiment: channel-rotation. Tier T1.

This is a SANCTIONED RESTRUCTURE under an approved plan, not a routine append
(trap 60). It MOVES bytes; it never rewrites them. `verify` re-derives the
original from archive + active and asserts equality block-for-block.

Two files are rotated:

  HELM-FEEDBACK.md   4.9 MB. Commit c7a597a8 flattened the whole 12,254-line
                     file onto ONE line and re-encoded it through cp437
                     (trap 60c), then a later append did it again -- so the
                     4.93 MB is TWO mojibake copies of one history. That
                     history is still readable in git at f4af3b5f. The
                     archive therefore carries the RECOVERED READABLE text,
                     not the corrupt bytes. Proven by scripts/probe-uncovered.py:
                     the only content unique to the flattened bytes is the
                     4,519-byte PR #564 entry, which is recovered and kept.

  FABLE-FEEDBACK.md  1.1 MB, uncorrupted. Straight date rotation.

HELM.md / FABLE.md / DECISIONS.md are IN SCOPE but hold nothing older than
30 days (oldest content anywhere is 2026-08-21), so they are not touched.
`report` is the evidence for that.

DRA-207 generalised the partitioner and the driver so the tool can target the
remaining ledgers. Three limits were removed; nothing above changed.

  * The entry unit is a parameter (`--unit`, default 2). DRA-75 hardcoded
    level 2. SCRIBE.md keeps its entries at level 3 -- under level 2 the tool
    saw 2 blocks in a 200 KB file and reported nothing to rotate.

  * The date source is a parameter (`--date-from`, default `heading`). None of
    SCRIBE.md's 89 level-3 headings carry a date, so `heading` leaves every
    entry undated; `body` falls back to the first date in the block. It never
    overrides a heading date.

  * `rotate` takes files, a `--card` and a `--date`, on the same partition path
    `report` uses, and writes. With no file argument it still runs the frozen
    DRA-75 pair: `rotate_helm` and `rotate_fable` are untouched, because they
    encode two incident-specific recoveries that must not be generalised away.
    Their output is byte-for-byte what main's script produces; that is a
    done-bar condition, proved by running both scripts on the same input.

  * The archive banner's holds sentence is a parameter (`--holds`, OFF by
    default). DRA-75 hardcoded it because both files it rotated were
    Helm-adjacent feedback channels, and DRA75_HOLDS stays those bytes
    (history). Since DRA-569 holds live in HANDOFF.md; the sentence is not
    today's flow. It is also false of SCRIBE.md, DECISIONS.md and BEVEL.md --
    stamping it into their archives asserts a hold mechanic they do not have,
    which is the hardcoded-card-id defect one field over.

Two rules the general path enforces that DRA-75 did not need:

  * Undated entries are KEPT LIVE. An entry with no date has not been shown to
    be old. (SCRIBE.md: 23 entries, 25,799 B.)

  * Re-rotating a file OVERWRITES its earlier archive with a smaller one and
    still reports success. `rotate` refuses when the archive already exists or
    the file already carries a rotation pointer, unless `--force`.

Byte conservation (preamble + archived + kept == input) is asserted before any
write. This tool MOVES bytes; it never rewrites them.

DRA-211 made the SECOND rotation of a file safe, which is what DRA-154's weekly
cadence produces by construction. DRA-207 left two things contained rather than
fixed, and they were related:

  * A rotation marker is a dated entry and archived ITSELF. `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`
    opens with `## 2026-09-14 / 2026-09-17 - THIS CHANNEL HAS BEEN ROTATED
    TWICE ...`, whose own body says "This marker stays live in every future
    pass"; `BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md` line 1 is the same shape. `block_date` reads
    2026-09-14 off both, so any later cutoff moved the file's own rotation
    record into the archive. Markers are now HELD LIVE regardless of date --
    a marker is metadata ABOUT the file, not an entry of its history.

  * `--force` was a one-way door: the archive write was `write_bytes(header +
    moved)`, which REPLACES. Every archive write now goes through
    `write_archive`, which refuses any proposal that is not a byte-prefix
    extension of what is already on disk. That refusal is UNCONDITIONAL --
    `--force` cannot override it, because the whole point is that no flag
    should be able to drop archived history.

  The append question is answered APPEND, not a new dated file per pass. That
  is what DRA-165's hand-carried second FABLE pass already did (both passes are
  in the one immutable `2026-Q3/FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`, and the live marker table
  records them that way), and it keeps true the one path the live pointer
  names. A second pass writes a `## ` PASS MARKER into the archive ahead of its
  entries -- a heading of its own on purpose, because an unheaded separator
  would be swallowed by the last archived entry, and `verify` compares entries
  byte-for-byte, so it would report real history as LOST.

  The append machinery (`write_archive`, the prefix refusal, the pass marker)
  is DRA-175's, written on PR #696 against pre-DRA-207 main and never merged;
  DRA-211 carries it onto the generalised `rotate_file` path. #696 additionally
  holds the `rotate_helm` zero-flattened-lines SKIP and the nothing-to-move
  guard for the frozen pair, which are still its to land.

DRA-175 / PR #696 lands that remainder on the FROZEN pair, and only there --
the 2026-09-17 ruling names an append-safe FABLE-only patch. Three arms, each
one measured against main at 6dc9b3b8:

  * `rotate_helm` SKIPS on zero flattened lines. DRA-75 removed both, so the
    `assert len(idx) == 2` fires and kills the WHOLE `rotate` command before the
    FABLE half runs -- `rotate --cutoff 2026-09-08` and `--cutoff 2026-09-15`
    both die there, rc=1, so even the dry run cannot be read. That is how the
    FABLE half stayed unmeasured. It never re-rotates HELM-FEEDBACK.md; that
    room is DRA-154's.

  * `rotate_fable` APPENDS on a second pass, through DRA-211's `write_archive`
    and `PASS_MARKER`. Without it the frozen path can only ever propose
    `header + moved`, which `write_archive` correctly REFUSES -- safe, but it
    makes a second FABLE rotation impossible rather than append-only, and the
    weekly DRA-154 cadence produces second passes by construction.

  * Nothing to move writes NOTHING. `write_archive` cannot catch this one: a
    header-only proposal against an empty archive is a legal first write, and
    against a populated one the refusal fires but the run exits 2 on a tree
    whose correct answer is "no work". That is the tree at the default cutoff.

A second pass does NOT write a second pointer. The active file's pointer block
is hand-written prose (DRA-165 consolidated two passes into one table);
regenerating it would be an Executor trimming channel content (DRA-26 rev 3
section 5), so the tool REPORTS the cumulative numbers an appended pass makes
stale instead of inventing a third pointer that contradicts the other two.

Pick the unit and the date source per file from `report`; do not guess them.
`report --show-blocks` lists every entry with its resolved date and its
archive/keep/hold disposition -- read that back before rotating anything.
`selftest` proves the DRA-211 arms and proves the refusal FIRES (trap 78).
