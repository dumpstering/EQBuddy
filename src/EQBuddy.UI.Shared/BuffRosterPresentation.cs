/// THE BUFF ROSTER — every buff believed active on you, as chips (OE-4, Bevel item 1,
/// Helm-signed #347).
///
/// **What changed and why.** The roster was one full-width row per buff (name left, clock
/// right), which the owner read as "needs to be far more compact". The row was already as
/// tight as a row gets — 1px margin, no icon — so the lever was never margin, it was
/// SHAPE: N buffs now fill the card's width before they grow its height.
///
/// **Same chips as the HUD row, not a second chip style.** These are
/// <see cref="HudChipEntry"/> values in <see cref="HudChipFamily.Buff"/>, drawn by the same
/// renderer the deadline row uses, so the two buff surfaces cannot drift into two visual
/// languages. What they do NOT share is the warn-window GATE: the HUD row shows a buff only
/// once it is expiring (a deadline with an action), and this is the full roster (a list you
/// look away for). One family, two audiences — the filter lives in <see cref="Shown"/>.
///
/// **The gauge measures a different thing here, on purpose.**
/// <see cref="HudChipRow.BuffChips"/> draws the share of the WARNING WINDOW left, because a
/// 27-minute Clarity that only earns a chicklet for its last minute would otherwise draw a
/// bar frozen at 99% for the whole of that chicklet's life. A roster chip is on screen for
/// the buff's whole life, so its bar is the share of the BUFF left — an actual buff bar,
/// which is the only reading that means anything across a full list.
///
/// Framework-free like everything in this project: the WPF layer has no unit tests
/// (docs/TestPlan.md §5), so the decisions live here where they can be asserted with no
/// window.
