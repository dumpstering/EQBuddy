/// David answered this directly on 2026-08-20, asked as its own question: a phone's
/// clipboard cannot paste into the game running on the PC, so a ⧉ copy button on
/// EQBuddy Mobile is a control that lies about what it does. Selectable text is honest —
/// you are looking at the phone and typing on the PC, which is what the second screen is
/// for — and it still satisfies the standing rule that a surface naming a command must
/// hand the exact text over (David, 2026-08-14).
///
/// The desktops keep their buttons. This is the same fact wearing the affordance the
/// device can actually keep, and it comes off <see cref="GameCommands"/> like every
/// other copy source, so the phone can never show a command the PC has stopped using.
