/// firewall is fine, and stops — while the rule is pointing at an install path this build
/// no longer runs from. That is exactly what DRA-64 turned out to be: the v2 build runs
/// from <c>%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQBuddy Evolved\publish\</c> and every allow rule on the machine
/// named the v1 path. Hence <see cref="FirewallRuleCommand"/> — the rule has to name THIS
