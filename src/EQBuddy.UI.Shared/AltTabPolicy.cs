/// from the Alt+Tab switcher AND from the taskbar. The two are not separable, so the
/// setting has to say so: the tray icon becomes the only way back to a hidden widget,
/// and a control that quietly removes someone's way back is the kind of thing this repo
/// treats as broken rather than as a trade-off.
///
/// (Until the Windows-only cleanup it also carried an "unavailable on this platform"
/// note for macOS/Linux, which have no per-window switcher opt-out; that note could only
/// ever be empty on Evolved and left with the v1 lanes.)
