/// The minimized bar's contents, decided once (Gate 5c).
///
/// Both widgets carried this table by hand, identically, right down to the comments —
/// which stat gets which glyph, how each value is formatted, and what order they sit in.
/// Two copies of one decision is the shape every drift in this codebase has started from
/// (#184, #122, #152), and it was the densest remaining cluster of glyphs on the surface
/// that is on screen the ENTIRE time a player is farming.
///
/// The glyphs are gone. Every icon here already existed in <see cref="IconPaths"/>, so
/// this cost no new geometry — a fair sign the vectors were being ignored rather than
/// missing. On the Linux and macOS builds a glyph can fail to render altogether (#148,
/// #166), and the minimized bar is precisely where a player is not looking closely enough
/// to notice a box where a skull should be.
///
/// **Deliberately not a size decision.** This says what a cell CONTAINS, never how wide it
/// is. Both widgets are <c>SizeToContent</c>, so a value that changes width on a timer
/// asks the window manager to resize an always-on-top window over a fullscreen game —
/// which cost #173 its keyboard. Reserved widths belong to the bar that draws these, and
/// arrive with #191 (TheMegaSage) when its contents become configurable.
