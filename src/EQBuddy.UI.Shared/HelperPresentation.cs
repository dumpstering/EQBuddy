/// <para><b>Why the words left Core.</b> <c>UnlockGuidance</c> — the mini-recommender this
/// feature copies its manners from — phrases its own four sentences in Core, and that is
/// right for four sentences drawn on one surface. The Helper says something about nine goals
/// across two hosts, and the rule it has to keep is a rule about <b>vocabulary</b>: HOME-006
/// forbids any line that claims a camp is safe, easy or survivable. A guard over vocabulary
/// can only be written where the vocabulary is. So the engine carries numbers and this file
/// carries language, and <c>HelperPresentationTests</c> sweeps every sentence this file can
/// produce — including the ones it assembles from a fixture, not only its constants, because
/// a ban that only reads <c>const</c> fields cannot see a word that arrives through an
/// interpolation.</para>
///
/// <para><b>HOME-006 IS A REFUSAL, NOT A CAVEAT.</b> There is no sentence here that says a
/// place is safe, and no sentence that says one is dangerous either. Where the player has
/// died, <see cref="Why"/> reports the deaths as their own history and stops; where they
/// have not, nothing is said at all — "you have never died here" is one sitting away from
/// being false, and a recommender that offered it would be making exactly the claim the
/// requirement exists to forbid. The rule is not that the wording is careful. The rule is
/// that the sentence does not exist.</para>
///
/// <para><b>HOME-004 arrives as a suffix nobody can forget.</b> Every fact carries an
/// <see cref="Evidence"/> tag, and <see cref="Why"/> appends <see cref="CatalogLabel"/> to
/// every <see cref="Evidence.Catalog"/> line by construction rather than by remembering —
/// so a new catalog-sourced fact is labelled the day it is added, by the switch that has to
/// grow to accommodate it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>HOME-003 arrives as a scope.</b> A personal line names what it rests on —
