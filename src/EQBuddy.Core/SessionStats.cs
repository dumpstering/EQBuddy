/// re-derives badly tomorrow, and both of these are cheap folds over data already held.
///
/// **Derived purely from event totals, anchored on the last log timestamp** — no wall
/// clock anywhere in it. That was a choice with a real alternative: <see
/// cref="StatsSnapshot.CurrentDps"/> reads <c>DateTime.Now</c> to decide whether a fight
/// is still live, and it is the one field the snapshot memo has to carry a caveat for

///
/// The cost is honest and small: a player who stops playing keeps whatever weight the
