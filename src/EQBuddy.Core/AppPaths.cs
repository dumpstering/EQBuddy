/// any door that bypassed those two scripts — a published Evolved exe, double-clicked — ran
/// Evolved **on the v1 profile**, and <c>AppSettings.ApplyMigrations</c> rewrote it on the
/// first load. That is trap 42's shape (present in the script ≠ in effect at runtime)
/// standing in front of a player's data, and closing it is TR-1's first change, before any
/// transition surface exists (Fable's transition plan §0.2 / §7, Helm-signed).

/// luck: they set <c>EQBUDDY_APPDATA</c> to <c>%AppData%\EQBuddy Evolved</c>, which is the

/// <see cref="IsProductOwnedProfile"/> is the question that difference matters for — a

/// isolated profile, and nothing about the v1 transition may happen inside one.
///
