/// 41 open-topped (see <see cref="Band.Max"/>) — and the remaining 31 either carry no row or
/// carry a shape the transform refuses to read (`1-15, 35`, `20-40+ (50+ inside pit)`,
/// `Quest Only`). Those ship too, in <c>NoBand</c>, because "the page does not answer" and
/// "we have never read a page for this zone" are different sentences — see
/// <see cref="Lookup"/>'s four outcomes. Read
/// <c>scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/zonelevels-report.md</c> before relying on the coverage.</para>
///
/// <para>D1 shipped the instrument; <b>DRA-84 D2 is the first reader</b> —
