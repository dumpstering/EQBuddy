    // absorbed keys from HiddenSections, and then declined to re-hide "loot" because
    // `hidden >= present` counted a "gear" that no player could ever have hidden (it has no
    // row in Options). One launch, one un-hidden Gear & Loot card, for as long as the
    // player kept launching. See SectionFoldIdempotenceTests.

    // A genuinely old profile that still carries its own "gear" key is unaffected: the fold
    // reads SectionOrder, not this default, and folds it exactly as it always did.
