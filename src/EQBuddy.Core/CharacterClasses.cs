/// **The premise this exists to fix.** EQBuddy resolved "which class is this" to a single
/// string, or `""` when two were close — and a Legends character is up to THREE classes at
/// once (David, 2026-08-23: *"you seem to think EQ Legends just lets you have 1 class when
/// in fact you can be 3 at a time"*). Every class-aware surface read that one string: the
/// Quest Tracker's filters, the Gear Locker (#104), the Sky class lens, the next-level
/// unlock list, EQBuddy Mobile. The premise underneath all of them was wrong, which is why
/// this is Core and pure rather than a patch at each seam.
///
/// **Precedence, and the reason for it.** The achievements dump names every class the
/// character holds as a fact the GAME wrote — better evidence than any log heuristic can
/// be, and it has been arriving by itself since 1.98.1's auto-import. Inference is the
/// fallback for players who have never dumped. The Quest Tracker's picks are LAST and are
/// a LENS: #104 established that a player may widen them to help a friend, so picks may
/// add classes but must never be the thing that tells the app what the character IS.
/// Bevel's lock — *"inferred classes in play; never fall back to the Quest Tracker
/// filter"* — becomes satisfiable here for the first time, and is honoured.
///
/// **The dump is an unlock HISTORY, not a roster** (DRA-262, signed plan Ruling 1). What
/// the achievements file states is every class the character has ever UNLOCKED —
/// `Companion/CompanionQuestSource.cs` has drawn that distinction all along: *an earned
/// unlock may never be played.* The game states the ROSTER nowhere EQBuddy reads.
/// Measured on the Founder's own character, 2026-09-21: his dump yields Paladin · Warrior
/// · Druid on every re-run and he is Warrior · Cleric · Enchanter — one name in three, and
/// no re-run can correct it, because the list is already at <see cref="Max"/> and a union
/// only ever widens. So the dump is the best DEFAULT reading and nothing more, and the
/// player's statement is not a memory arguing with the game's writing — it is the only
/// roster source that exists. See the <c>stated</c> parameter for what that buys.
///
/// The dump still leads whenever nobody has stated anything, and a qualifying inferred
/// class joins it rather than being suppressed by it — a class unlocked after the last
/// dump would otherwise be invisible until the next one, while the log is plainly showing
/// it. Dump entries first there, because they are the certain half.
