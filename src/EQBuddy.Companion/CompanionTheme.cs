/// THE CONVERSION (#AARRGGBB → CSS). Palette values carry alpha because the desktop
/// widget floats over the running game; the browser needs web colors:
///   • opaque (AA = FF) → "#RRGGBB".
///   • translucent      → "rgba(R, G, B, A/255)" — alpha PRESERVED rather than
///     flattened, because the page layers exactly like the widget does (panels and
///     washes over the background) and CSS composites it for free.
///   • the background token is the ONE exception: always emitted opaque. Its alpha
///     exists so the GAME shows through, and behind a browser page there is nothing
///     to show through — honoring it would blend the phone's own white paper in.
/// Derived tones (hairline, track, raised, accent-deep) come from
/// <see cref="ThemeTones"/>, the same helper WPF composes its brushes from, so the
/// phone can never drift from the desktop's derived look.
