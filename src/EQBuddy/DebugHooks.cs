///
/// **Why the lift, and why in this PR.** These sixteen hooks share one job and one
/// reason: *a surface that can only be opened by a human clicking a menu cannot be
/// photographed, and a surface nobody can review reads as reviewed anyway* (trap 22).
/// None of them is window LOGIC — every branch is `if (env) Loaded += … call a method` —
/// so they are exactly what the hotspot ratchet means by "lift a whole surface into its
/// own class the way QuestChecklistView was", and they were the only 135 contiguous
/// lines in the constructor that owed nothing to the widget's own state.
///
/// The widget was at 4,699 lines against a 4,700 limit when E-3 opened, with one line of
/// headroom left on purpose: Fable's plan makes that number E-3's decomposition budget
/// and requires the baseline to come down in the same commit as each move, or the freed
/// room quietly refills. The shell needed a field and a hook; this is what paid for them.
/// The baseline came down to match in <c>ArchitectureTests.Hotspots</c>.
///
/// **Registration ORDER is preserved exactly**, because these are <c>Loaded</c> handlers
/// and several open windows that stack: a re-ordering here would be invisible in a diff
/// and would show up as a screenshot of the wrong window on top (trap 24's failure mode
/// arriving through a different door). Nothing in the move is a rewrite.
