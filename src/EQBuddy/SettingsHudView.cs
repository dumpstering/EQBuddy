/// <summary>
/// **The HUD block, host-neutral** — everything Settings knows about what EQBuddy PUTS ON
/// SCREEN while you play: which panels the widget shows and in what order, which stats fill
/// the minimised HUD, which floating windows may open, whether a double-click on a chip
/// toggles one, whether the Loot panel lists the target's drops, and how long the
/// "recent rate" window is.
///
/// **Blocks, not tabs, are the unit that moves** (Fable's SR series; <see cref="SettingsAlertsView"/>
/// was the first, <see cref="SettingsLookView"/> and <see cref="SettingsBehaviorView"/> the pair
/// before this one). It builds its own controls, carries its own visibility and spacing
/// (trap 15), and knows nothing about the window it hangs in — so v1 <c>OptionsWindow</c> keeps
/// its five tabs while the Evolved shell's Settings room composes the SAME block. **Each host
/// constructs its own instance** (trap 45), and **both hosts wrap one <c>AppSettings</c>**
/// (trap 13) — the block never loads settings for itself, because a second snapshot clobbers
/// the first one wholesale (#169).
///
/// **In the shell this block renders under the tab name "HUD"; in v1 it keeps the
/// "Cards &amp; windows" tab label it shipped with.** That split is signed (Bevel I-11 §3, Helm
/// 2026-09-05): the terminology ban's own scope line exempts v1 <c>OptionsWindow</c>, and
/// renaming shipped v1 copy for no player benefit is the #228 class. **The tab name is SR-5's
/// to spell** — it lands with `SettingsSurface` and the room, and nothing here declares it.
///
/// **This block is TRANSITIONAL and must not be built as though it will stay this size.**
/// Bevel's ruling in as many words: Surface A's SA-R star-retirement empties the HUD-stat grid
/// and the floating-window list card by card, so each SA-R PR edits THIS ONE block and both
/// hosts follow. That is the whole argument for it being a shared module rather than two
/// screens, and it is also why there is no strip control, no tab enum and no extra structure in
/// here — a scaffold built for a shape that is scheduled to shrink is a scaffold with no
/// consumer (trap 43).
///
/// **The three editors belong together, which is why they are one class and not three.** They
/// are three views of overlapping state: ticking a floating window STARS its stat, a star is a
/// HUD cell, and hiding a panel does not touch either. Keeping them in one place is what makes
/// "rebuild the other list" a line of code rather than a cross-file callback — and a stale list
/// here is the "tick box that lies" this screen already had to fix once.
///
/// **The vocabulary sweep ran here** (§4 of `docs/BEVEL-v2-staging-critique.md`, Helm-signed;
/// Bevel's I-11 §5 named the hits in advance, and lifting a block IS that block's sweep). Six
/// sentences were reworded on the way through, once, for both hosts: the two headings, the
/// panel-list blurb, the HUD-stat tooltip and its blurb, the double-click label and the
/// target-drops pair. <see cref="BreakoutPresentation"/>'s three player consts were reworded at
/// their source for the same reason a shared const the block PRINTS is a string the block shows
/// (SR-1's <c>AltTabPolicy</c> precedent).
///
/// **The prose-to-hover pass ran here too (Pass 1; Bevel's faces, Helm-signed 2026-09-08).**
/// The owner's complaint is the SHAPE of the screen rather than its words: a paragraph under
/// every control turns a screen whose job is "find your switch and flip it" into an essay you
/// scroll past. Five explanations moved onto an ⓘ beside the thing they explain — the panel
/// list's, the mini dashboard's, the floating-window list's, and the two under the
/// double-click and target-drops switches. **Not one word was rewritten**; the consts below
/// are the strings that shipped, hanging somewhere else. <see cref="SettingsProsePolicy"/> is
/// the rule that decided which, and <see cref="RecentRateBlurb"/> is the negative that keeps
/// it from meaning "hide everything": ten words is a caption, and it stayed in the body.
///
/// **DRA-352 D2 took three blocks off this screen, by Founder direction on the card's own
/// screenshot (2026-09-23).** The "No longer on the widget" catalog (<c>OverlaySections</c>'
/// retired list — Helm LOCKED the drop, data and all); the two Mini-dashboard notes that
/// Pass 1 had exempted from the hover rule, with the Restore-default-order button under them
/// (<c>MiniBarOrder</c> keeps its bar-drag writer, so an order is undone by dragging); and
/// the Floating windows list. That list was the ONE writer of
/// <c>AppSettings.DisabledBreakouts</c>, so the write MOVED before the list went (traps
/// 20/26): it is the pin on each floating window's own title bar now
/// (<see cref="BreakoutHost.SetAutoOpen"/>), which is the surface a player is looking at when
/// they decide a window should or should not open by itself.
