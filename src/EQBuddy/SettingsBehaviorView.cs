/// <summary>
/// **The Behavior block, host-neutral** — everything Settings knows about how EQBuddy acts
/// rather than how it looks: EQBuddy Mobile pairing and its sounds switch, the three
/// hide-when rules and the Alt+Tab note, keep-above-overlays, the global hotkey rows, the
/// regen-per-tick override, auto-empty and its archive, the launch tutorial, and the perf
/// readout.
///
/// **Blocks, not tabs, are the unit that moves** (Fable's SR series; <see cref="SettingsAlertsView"/>
/// is the precedent, and <see cref="SettingsLookView"/> is this block's twin). It builds its own
/// controls, carries its own visibility and spacing (trap 15), and knows nothing about the
/// window it hangs in — so <c>OptionsWindow</c> keeps its five tabs while the Evolved shell's
/// Settings room composes the SAME block. **Each host constructs its own instance** (trap 45),
/// and **both hosts wrap one <see cref="AppSettings"/>** (trap 13) — the block never loads
/// settings for itself, because a second snapshot clobbers the first one wholesale (#169).
///
/// **EQBuddy Mobile's pairing panel moves WITH this block, and the title-bar 📱 button is
/// untouched.** CLAUDE.md's own carve-out — *"Settings live in Options — except EQBuddy Mobile,
/// which David wanted as its own title-bar button"* — makes that button the standing second
/// door, and Settings becoming the only path in would violate the rule by omission rather than
/// by edit. The panel says so in its own helper line, which is why the line names the button.
///
/// **The one thing this block cannot own on its own: the KEY that a hotkey recorder captures.**
/// Rebuilding the rows on every click means the recording button is a new control with no
/// focus, so the press arrives at the WINDOW rather than anywhere inside this panel — which is
/// why <see cref="HandleRecordingKey"/> is a method a host forwards its <c>PreviewKeyDown</c>
/// to rather than a handler attached in here. The DECISION is the block's; the routing is the
/// host's, exactly like the window chrome the lift left behind. A host that forgets to forward
/// gets a recorder that never records, so <c>SettingsLookBehaviorBlockTests</c> asserts the
/// forward on the host as well as the method here.
///
/// **The vocabulary sweep ran here** (§4 of `docs/BEVEL-v2-staging-critique.md`, Helm-signed;
/// Bevel's I-11 §5 named the hits in advance). A block serving two hosts has ONE string set and
/// it must pass in shell scope: the three "hide the widget" labels, the alt-tab note's aside
/// about chips and breakout windows, and the keep-above paragraph's two "widget"s are EQBuddy's
/// own name now. <see cref="AltTabPolicy.TaskbarWarning"/> was reworded at its source in
/// UI.Shared for the same reason — a shared const this block prints is a string the block shows,
/// wherever it is declared.
