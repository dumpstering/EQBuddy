/// <summary>
/// **The Behavior block, host-neutral** — everything Settings knows about how EQBuddy acts
/// rather than how it looks: EQBuddy Mobile pairing and its sounds switch, the three
/// hide-when rules and the Alt+Tab note, keep-above-overlays, the global hotkey rows, the
/// regen-per-tick override, auto-empty and its archive, the launch tutorial, and the perf
/// readout.
///
/// **Blocks, not tabs, are the unit that moves** (Fable's SR series; <see cref="SettingsAlertsView"/>
/// is the precedent, and <see cref="SettingsLookView"/> is this block's twin). It builds its own
/// controls, carries its own visibility and spacing (trap 15), and knows nothing about the
/// window it hangs in — so <c>OptionsWindow</c> keeps its five tabs while the Evolved shell's
/// Settings room composes the SAME block. **Each host constructs its own instance** (trap 45),
/// and **both hosts wrap one <see cref="AppSettings"/>** (trap 13) — the block never loads
/// settings for itself, because a second snapshot clobbers the first one wholesale (#169).
///
/// **EQBuddy Mobile's pairing panel moves WITH this block, and the title-bar 📱 button is
/// untouched.** CLAUDE.md's own carve-out — *"Settings live in Options — except EQBuddy Mobile,
/// which David wanted as its own title-bar button"* — makes that button the standing second
/// door, and Settings becoming the only path in would violate the rule by omission rather than
/// by edit. The panel says so in its own helper line, which is why the line names the button.
///
/// **The one thing this block cannot own on its own: the KEY that a hotkey recorder captures.**
/// Rebuilding the rows on every click means the recording button is a new control with no
/// focus, so the press arrives at the WINDOW rather than anywhere inside this panel — which is
/// why <see cref="HandleRecordingKey"/> is a method a host forwards its <c>PreviewKeyDown</c>
/// to rather than a handler attached in here. The DECISION is the block's; the routing is the
/// host's, exactly like the window chrome the lift left behind. A host that forgets to forward
/// gets a recorder that never records, so <c>SettingsLookBehaviorBlockTests</c> asserts the
/// forward on the host as well as the method here.
///
/// **The vocabulary sweep ran here** (§4 of `docs/BEVEL-v2-staging-critique.md`, Helm-signed;
/// Bevel's I-11 §5 named the hits in advance). A block serving two hosts has ONE string set and
/// it must pass in shell scope: the three "hide the widget" labels, the alt-tab note's aside
/// about chips and breakout windows, and the keep-above paragraph's two "widget"s are EQBuddy's
/// own name now. <see cref="AltTabPolicy.TaskbarWarning"/> was reworded at its source in
/// UI.Shared for the same reason — a shared const this block prints is a string the block shows,
/// wherever it is declared.
///
/// **The prose-to-hover pass reached this block in Pass 2** (Bevel's faces, Helm-signed
/// 2026-09-08; <see cref="SettingsProsePolicy"/> is the arithmetic). This is the heaviest tab
/// in Settings and it lost the most: EIGHT explanations moved onto an ⓘ beside the thing they
/// explain — <see cref="HideUnfocusedBlurb"/>, <see cref="KeepAboveBlurb"/>,
/// <see cref="HotkeysBlurb"/>, <see cref="RegenOverrideBlurb"/>,
/// <see cref="AutoEmptyBlurb"/>, <see cref="ArchiveBlurb"/>,
/// <see cref="PerfReadoutBlurb"/> and <see cref="SetupReadout.BehaviorNote"/>. Not one word
/// was rewritten; the consts above are the strings that shipped, hanging somewhere else.
///
/// **THREE paragraphs deliberately did NOT move, and they are this block's judgement.** Each
/// is a row with its reason in `SettingsProsePass2Tests` so a later pass cannot "finish the
/// job" silently:
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>The Alt+Tab note</b> (<see cref="AltTabPolicy.TaskbarWarning"/>). It is the one
///   printed sentence in the product that names the tray icon as the way back to a hidden
///   EQBuddy — a DOOR, and the switch it sits under is the switch that closes the other two.
///   Behind an ⓘ, a player who ticks the box without hovering has lost the only place they
///   were told (traps 29/34/59). It is also 21 words, one over the ceiling, and the string
///   this block actually prints is <c>TaskbarWarning + UnavailableNote</c>, whose length is
///   decided at RUNTIME by the platform — so the policy cannot answer for it either way.</item>
/// <item><b>The "hide while the game isn't running" note.</b> Same reason, different door:
///   "Launch EQBuddy again from the Start menu" appears nowhere else in the product, and it
///   is the answer to the question that switch creates. Its twin above it DID move, because
///   alt-tabbing back to the game is automatic rather than a door anybody has to find.</item>
/// <item><b>EQBuddy Mobile's two lines.</b> The panel's own is the standing record of
///   CLAUDE.md's carve-out — the title-bar 📱 button is a second door, and the comment above
///   <see cref="BuildSecondScreen"/> has always said the line names it on purpose. The sounds
///   switch's helper is <see cref="MobileAlertSounds.HelperText"/>, which exists to say the
///   DEFAULT out loud so nobody has to flip a switch to discover it; hiding it behind a hover
///   is that reason with the answer removed. It reaches the ceiling only because the block
///   prints it joined to <see cref="MobileAlertSounds.ScopeNote"/> — twelve words and eleven.</item>
