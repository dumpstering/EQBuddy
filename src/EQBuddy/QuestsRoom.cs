/// <summary>
/// The QUESTS room as the Evolved shell hosts it — Quests · Epic 1.0 · Plane of Sky ·
/// Unlocks, the fourth surface moved in (E-3 Phase 2 PR 3).
///
/// **Why Quests came after World and Gear, and alone.** Bevel's signed pre-design sorts
/// the remaining rooms by which IA verdict is already PAID FOR, not by size:
/// <c>WorldWindow</c> and <c>GearLootWindow</c> were already one window each, composed of
/// exactly the tabs a room needs, so hosting them was a MOVE. Quests had the tabs too —
/// but no view: 2,481 lines of window-owned rendering with nothing an
/// <see cref="IShellRoom"/> could be handed. So this is a LIFT, which is the shape that
/// has cost this repo real bugs (trap 46: what was the old host doing for the surface
/// every tick; trap 20's mirror: a rule with a home and no reader), and it earned its own
/// diff for that reason rather than for its line count.
///
/// **The lift itself is <see cref="QuestsView"/>, and it moved no rule.** All five
/// Helm-signed presentation rules the pre-design asked to be inventoried are properties of
/// the SURFACE and stayed inside it — the #241 turn-in provenance sentence, the Sky
/// leftover bands, their session-only folds, the Ready-band unlocked caveat, and the Sky
/// tab's two ⧉ commands. Nothing about them is re-decided here, and this room could not
/// re-decide them if it wanted to: it owns one view and asks it questions.
///
/// **It builds its OWN view and hands none out** (trap 45). A WPF <c>UIElement</c> has
/// exactly one parent, so a view shared with <see cref="QuestsWindow"/> would be torn out
/// of whichever host painted it last — silently, with no exception to point at.
///
/// **What the WINDOW does that this room does NOT** (trap 26: name every control and say
/// where it went):
///
///  * **The chrome** — the hand-drawn title row, the close button, the drag handler,
///    <c>WindowZoom</c>, <c>ScreenGuard</c> placement, the <c>Left</c>/<c>Top</c>
///    persistence and the monitor-derived <c>MaxHeight</c>. The shell supplies all of it
///    natively, once, for every room; <see cref="QuestsView.HideOwnTitleBar"/> is how the
///    view stops drawing a second copy, exactly as <c>SpawnsView</c> does in
///    <see cref="WorldRoom"/>.
///  * **…except the CHARACTER, which is the one thing that title row said and no other
///    room's did.** "Quest Tracker — Dranak" names whose quests these are, and the shell's
///    native title bar reads "EQBuddy — Guide" and cannot. So it is not dropped: the view
///    composes the string (one producer) and this room draws it as a caption above the
///    tabs. That is the whole visible difference between the two hosts, and it exists
///    because losing it would be trap 26's sentence — the data survived the move and the
///    thing that showed it did not.
///  * **The height cap.** <see cref="QuestsWindow"/> is <c>SizeToContent="Height"</c>, so
///    it must cap the view's two scrollers or a long catalog walks the footnotes off the
///    screen. This room is a bounded <c>*</c> cell in the shell — a real overflow — so it
///    asks for no cap at all. Scrolling belongs to the host (trap 36) and here the host
///    genuinely has a height to give.
///
/// **This is the first room to express <see cref="ShellLayout.RoomSinglePane"/>**, whose
/// comment has said *"no room expresses this yet"* since PR 1. The Turn-ins pane is a
/// list+detail layout, so below <c>SplitRoomWidth</c> it collapses to one pane with a way
/// back. The decision is the shell's and arrives through <see cref="ApplyLayout"/>; the
/// arrangement is the view's. Nothing here computes a width.
///
/// **Subtraction blocker, written at the PR that adds the room** (the World deaths-star /
/// Gear loot-star pattern, and Helm's per-item gate of 2026-09-04): this PR does not
/// retire <see cref="QuestsWindow"/>. It may only go once this room is on the rail (it is),
/// a screenshot proves parity (`shell-quests`, `shell-quests-sky`, `shell-quests-narrow`),
/// and the widget's Quests LAUNCHER card has somewhere to point — that card is gone (HUD
/// subtraction cut 1) and since 2026-09-08 the widget's `Guide…` row points HERE rather than
/// at the window. What still reaches `MainWindow.ShowQuestsWindow` is the map badge in the
/// Loot views and the `toggleQuests` hotkey, so the window is not orphaned — but it no
/// longer has a menu row, which is the condition the rest of this paragraph was waiting on. **Nothing here writes a `MiniStats` key**, so unlike
/// World and Gear this room takes no last-writer with it.
