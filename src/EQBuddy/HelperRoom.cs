///
/// <para>Two blocks: the goals you pick, and the answers weighed against them. Everything

/// and catalogs EQBuddy ships — there is no comparison with anybody else and no number that
/// came off somebody else's screen.</para>
///
/// <para><b>WHY IT IS ITS OWN ROOM AND NOT A BLOCK INSIDE CHARACTER.</b> The obvious place
/// for "what next" is the room the shell opens on, and the obvious place is refused by two
/// standing locks that room carries. <c>HomeRoom</c>'s own summary says
/// <i>"THE HOME/LIVE BOUNDARY IS THE THING TO BREAK LAST"</i> — no combat numbers, no
/// previews of Raids or Faction — and <c>HomeReadout</c> carries a tombstone against
/// rebuilding the "Go to" link block the Founder cut in DRA-63. A recommender draws exactly
/// that content: rate arithmetic, faction lines, and a door on every row. Growing Character
/// would mean amending both locks three days after the Founder's smoke settled that room's
/// shape, so the Helper takes the rail slot directly beneath it instead, and the 2026-09-06
/// lock — <i>"Home stays the guidance hub … not a second metrics dashboard"</i> — is honored
/// by the hub getting its own row one line down. The alternative was named for Helm's veto in
/// the plan and Helm KEPT the room.</para>
///
/// <para><b>THE GOALS ARE THE FOUNDER'S NINE, VERBATIM</b>, and five of them say they are not
/// answered yet. That is deliberate rather than unfinished: the list is what he wrote down,
/// a goal that vanished until its engine landed would make the feature look smaller than the
/// plan it is executing, and each deferred one hands over the door to the room that answers
/// its question TODAY. A goal that produced one apologetic sentence and pointed nowhere would
/// be the rail's own forbidden shape — <i>"an affordance that opens nothing is a trap"</i> —
/// reappearing one level in, where the rail's guard cannot see it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>THEY ARE ONE DROPDOWN SINCE DRA-71 D2, NOT NINE CHIPS.</b> D1 drew them as a
/// <c>WrapPanel</c> of <see cref="EqChip"/>s, and the Founder smoked it and called the result
/// flat checkbox soup — nine pills the player has to read before they can do anything, with
/// every sub-picker a later slice adds widening the same wall. So the nine are rows inside one
/// <see cref="EqMultiPicker"/> and the faction sub-picker is a second face that exists only
/// once its goal is picked. Nothing about what the room DECIDES moved: the same nine, the same
/// per-character store, the same empty-means-all.</para>
///
/// <para><b>NO WORD ON THIS SURFACE IS WRITTEN HERE.</b> Every sentence comes from
/// <see cref="HelperPresentation"/>, which is where HOME-006's vocabulary ban can be swept:
/// nothing the Helper says may claim a camp is safe, easy or survivable, and a rule about
/// words can only be guarded where the words are. This file decides layout and counts
/// controls, which is the half a launched app can prove and a source scan cannot (trap 29).</para>
///
/// <para><b>THE UNLOCK SUB-PICKER IS THE THIRD FACE, AND ITS STORE IS SHARED</b> (DRA-71 D5).
/// The Quests window's Unlocks tab reads and writes the same <c>AppSettings.UnlockPicks</c>
/// through the same <see cref="UnlockPickStore"/> — one producer of the pick, because a
/// selection made in one room and ignored in the other is the second room reading as broken.
/// The narrowing itself happens in the ENGINE rather than here, so the phone gets it the day
/// it calls <c>Recommendations.Rank</c>.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Trap 72 is the failure this room is most likely to have shipped.</b> The Quests
/// tab spent a session drawing the moment before because its repaint signature carried every
/// store except the two the feature wrote. The Helper reads eight stores and writes three, so
