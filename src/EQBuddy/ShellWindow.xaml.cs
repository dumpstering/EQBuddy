/// <summary>
/// The Evolved shell — one normal Windows window with a navigation rail down its left
/// edge and one room in it at a time. E-3 Phase 2 PR 1 landed **the host, the nav, and
/// exactly one room** (Progress), which is the World fold's own shape — host first — and
/// the only one that keeps a half-finished shell coherent at every commit. **PR 2 adds the
/// other two rooms that are a MOVE rather than a redesign**: World and Gear, whose Evolved
/// IA verdict (*"Keep → unify"*) a v1 fold has already satisfied. **PR 3 adds the one that
/// is a LIFT** — Quests, whose 2,481 lines of window-owned rendering had no view to hand a
/// host until <see cref="QuestsView"/> came out of <see cref="QuestsWindow"/>. **PR 4 adds
/// the one that is NEITHER** — <see cref="HomeRoom"/>, a new surface with no v1 window
/// behind it — and moves the default landing onto it. Five rows, five rooms.
///
/// **What is deliberately NOT here, and why each absence is a decision:**
///
///  * **Two of the seven rail rows.** <see cref="ShellPages.Landed"/> holds the rooms
///    that exist, and the rail draws that list rather than the full one. The honest
///    options for a half-built shell were a rail with the rooms that exist or seven rows
///    with the rest disabled, and this codebase already ruled on the second: *"an empty
///    class row gets no chevron — an affordance that opens nothing is a trap."* A room's
///    row lands in the PR that lands the room. Live does not exist yet (and Raids cannot
///    leave Progress until it does) and gets its own Bevel pass rather than riding another
///    room's PR, per the Helm-signed Quests → Home → Live order; Settings is a room whose
///    whole job is not being a launcher. **The same refusal now applies one level in**:
///    Home's deep-links block reads the same <c>Landed</c> list, so it cannot offer a way
///    into a room that does not exist either.
///  * **The Search INDEX.** The palette resolves against what the shell can currently
///    reach — the landed rooms and their tabs. The disposition-backed index that lets a
///    player find a feature by its old v1 name is E-2e's table, and Helm's sign is
///    explicit that Search CHROME may land with E-3 while the index waits, and that the
///    Progress host must not be blocked on it. So the palette is honest and small rather
///    than an empty box promising more.
///  * **The Progress RESHAPE.** Bevel's IA moves Raids to Live and Faction to Advanced.
///    Both need a Live room to move Raids INTO, so this PR hosts the four tabs exactly as
///    they ship today — the pre-design says so in as many words: the tab arrangement is
///    not redesigned, only the window it used to float in. Doing half of it here would
///    drop a surface on the floor between two PRs.
///  * **The mini-dashboard stars.** They are the only writers <c>MiniStats</c> has for
///    "xp", "money" and "motes", and a fold that drops the last writer of a setting is
///    the exact shape of #204/#209, #210 and #212 (trap 20/26). They are NOT lost — this
///    PR does not retire <see cref="ProgressWindow"/>, which still carries them. **When
///    that window is retired they must be rehomed**, and Bevel's IA says where: HUD
///    configuration belongs to the HUD's Edit mode and to Settings, never to a room.
///
/// It is <see cref="IFollowingSurface"/> like the six theme pop-outs, so it follows the
/// widget's tick and can say which snapshot it last painted — without which the
