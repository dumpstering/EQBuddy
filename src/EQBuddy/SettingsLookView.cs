/// <summary>
/// **The Look block, host-neutral** — everything Settings knows about what EQBuddy looks
/// like: the colour theme picker and its Custom rows, the four size/opacity sliders, the
/// alignment grid and its spacing, and the cursor ring.
///
/// **Blocks, not tabs, are the unit that moves** (Fable's SR series; <see cref="SettingsAlertsView"/>
/// is the precedent this file follows line for line). A block builds its own controls, carries
/// its own visibility and spacing (trap 15), and knows nothing about the window it hangs in —
/// so <c>OptionsWindow</c> keeps its five tabs in the arrangement players already have while
/// the Evolved shell's Settings room composes the SAME block under the signed four-tab IA. The
/// alternative — building the room fresh beside a live <c>OptionsWindow</c> — is two copies of
/// the same control wirings drifting until retirement day, #210's mechanism with a bigger
/// surface.
///
/// **Each host constructs its own instance** (trap 45). A WPF <c>UIElement</c> has exactly one
/// parent, so a block shared between two hosts is torn out of whichever painted it last —
/// silently on WPF, which is harder to notice than an exception, not easier.
///
/// **Both hosts wrap one <see cref="AppSettings"/>** (trap 13): the block takes the
/// <see cref="OptionsViewModel"/> its host already built over <c>MainWindow.Settings</c> and
/// never loads settings for itself, because a second snapshot clobbers the first one wholesale
/// on its next save (#169).
///
/// **What is deliberately NOT here: the window's own chrome.** "Drag either side edge to widen
/// this window" is a sentence about <c>OptionsWindow</c>'s resize grips — it is true of that
/// host and false of a shell room that has none, so it stays declared on the window, beside the
/// grips it describes. Same rule as the width persistence, the monitor clamp and the tab links.
///
/// **The vocabulary sweep ran here** (§4 of `docs/BEVEL-v2-staging-critique.md`, Helm-signed).
/// A block serving two hosts has ONE string set and it has to pass in shell scope, so lifting a
/// block IS that block's sweep: "Widget size" and "Whole-widget opacity" became EQBuddy's own
/// name. **"Theme" survives, and that is a ruling rather than an oversight** — the ban's
/// `\bthemes?\b` is written against the v1 sense (*"the Progress theme"*, a folded window
/// grouping); this label is the COLOUR theme picker, a real player-facing feature David rules
/// on (<see cref="ThemeCatalog"/>). Bevel flagged the collision before anyone could run a
/// mechanical rewrite over it (BEVEL.md I-11 §5), and the exemption is written down in
/// <c>ShellTerminologyTests.Exempt</c> where the next reader will find it.
///
/// **The prose-to-hover pass reached this tab in Pass 2** (Bevel's faces, Helm-signed
/// 2026-09-08; <see cref="SettingsProsePolicy"/> is the arithmetic). Exactly ONE paragraph
/// moved — <see cref="GridOverlayBlurb"/>, onto an ⓘ beside its tick box — and that small
/// number is the finding rather than a shortfall: this tab is mostly sliders with a caption
/// each, which is the shape the whole pass is trying to produce everywhere else. The three
/// short lines that stayed ("Only the dark panel fades", "Fades everything, text included",
/// and the closing "Size also scales all text") are all under the ceiling, and the cursor
/// ring's is eighteen words — one of the negatives that stops "convert the prose" turning
/// into "hide the prose".
