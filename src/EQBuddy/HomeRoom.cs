/// The HOME room — the sixth room of the Evolved shell, and the first one that is a NEW
/// surface rather than a move or a lift. Bevel's Home pre-design, Helm-signed 2026-09-05
/// ~5:20 AM CT. **A player reads "Character" since DRA-66** (Founder smoke: *"nothing home
/// about it; the page only helps capture game data for the rest of EQBuddy"*; label per
/// the Helm-signed plan's D1) — the class name, the enum member and every
/// <c>shellHome*</c> key deliberately did not move, the same discipline as the Quests
/// room reading "Guide" (<see cref="ShellPages.Label"/>).
///
/// **Three blocks: Identity · Readiness · Recent session.** They answer, in order, who
/// EQBuddy is following, what it is missing, and where you left off — which is
/// <see cref="ShellPages.Describe"/>'s one-line pitch for this room. DRA-66 put the class
/// reading and its correction inside the Identity block: WHO you are playing includes what
/// the character is, and the one answer every class-aware surface already shares
/// (<c>ClassSourceFor</c>) is finally shown somewhere a player can argue with it.
///
/// **The fourth was "Go to", and the Founder cut it on 2026-09-11 (DRA-63 smoke).** Bevel's
/// door 1 locked four blocks when the rail had one room on it; once every room had landed it
/// was a second copy of the rail sitting under the fold in the same window. The rail owns the
/// doors. See <see cref="HomeReadout"/>'s tombstone for what the deletion cost.
///
/// **This room is now what the shell OPENS on**, which is the other half of this PR:
/// <c>ShellWindow._page</c> was <c>Progress</c> as an explicit placeholder for a room
/// nobody had built, flagged in that file's own comment as the Home PR's to fix.
///
/// **THE HOME/LIVE BOUNDARY IS THE THING TO BREAK LAST.** Home is a DESK surface — the
/// product's own table says desktop is *"before and after play"* — and Live is the sitting
/// you are in. So Home carries **no combat numbers at all**: no DPS, no kills, no deaths,
/// no damage or healing, whether a session is running or finished. The temptation is not
/// hypothetical, it is one property access away — <c>_main.CurrentSnapshot()</c> is right
/// there in this file with all four on it, and a kill count on the "recent session" line
/// would look like a small harmless convenience rather than Live's job arriving three PRs
/// early. What stops it is not discipline: <see cref="RecentSession"/> has no such field to
/// reach for, by construction. **When Live lands it reads the same
/// <see cref="SessionSummary"/> fact** — that is why the fact is in <c>UI.Shared</c> and
/// not in this file — and adds the meters on its own surface.
///
/// **Nothing here previews Raids or Faction either.** Both are one property read away too,
/// and Bevel's door 3 already settled where they live (Raids goes to Live; Faction becomes
/// Advanced under Progress). Home does not show other rooms' contents, and since DRA-63 it
/// does not list their doors either.
///
/// **The one navigation left in this body is a readiness row's "Open"**, and it goes through
/// the shell's own <see cref="ShellWindow.Navigate"/>, handed in rather than re-implemented,
/// at an address filtered through <see cref="ShellPages.Landed"/> — the same list the rail
/// draws from. A hand-written address would put a row in a room's body that opens nothing,
/// which is the rail's own forbidden shape (*"an affordance that opens nothing is a trap"*)
/// reappearing one level in, where the rail's guard cannot see it.
/// <c>shellHomeDeadLinks</c> is the assertion that says so from outside, and it survived the
