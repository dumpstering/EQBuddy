/// <summary>
/// The standalone Quest Tracker (QUEST-*, David's spec 2026-08-07): every wiki quest
/// whose turn-in items overlap what this character owns — looted since the ledger began,
/// or read from the game's own /outputfile inventory dump (bags and bank). The quest name
/// opens the eqlwiki walkthrough; "all" flips from the overlap view to the whole catalog
/// for browsing ahead.
///
/// One search box is the way in (David, 2026-08-15) — it matches rewards, turn-in items,
/// quest names, givers and zones, so "I want the Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies" is a
/// first-class question.
///
/// GATE 2 of the UI/UX rework (docs/DesignSystem.md) rebuilt the presentation and NOTHING
/// else: same filters, same modes, same ledger calls, same undo, same search. What changed
/// is that a column of self-contained cards became a LIST plus a DETAIL PANE. Every card
/// carried its own rewards, meta line, item rows and five controls, so finding the one
/// quest that is ready meant reading fifty paragraphs. The list answers "which one" and
/// the pane answers "what about it", which is the order the question actually gets asked
/// in — and it is what made room for the status badge and the state rule that now carry
/// readiness at a glance.
///
/// ---
///
/// **LIFTED out of <c>QuestsWindow</c> for E-3 Phase 2 PR 3** — the Evolved shell needed
/// the CONTENT without the window, and there was no view to hand it: this was 2,481 lines
/// of window-owned rendering, which is why Bevel's pre-design called Quests *"an
/// extraction, not a redesign"* and why it got its own diff instead of riding PR 2 with
/// World and Gear. <c>SpawnsView</c> (World PR 1) is the precedent and the shape is
/// identical: the whole bordered panel comes across, chrome and content together, because
/// the window is borderless and hand-drawn and there is no clean seam at the XAML level.
/// <see cref="QuestsWindow"/> is now a thin host owning only what a literal OS window owns
/// — sizing, position, <c>DragMove</c>, <c>Close</c>, reached through
/// <see cref="Window.GetWindow(DependencyObject)"/> rather than a captured reference —
/// and <see cref="QuestsRoom"/> hosts the same view inside the shell.
///
/// **The lift moved no presentation rule and changed no wording.** The five Helm-signed
/// rules Bevel asked to be inventoried before the diff all live BELOW this line and all
/// stayed exactly where they were, because they are properties of the surface rather than
/// of the window around it: the #241 turn-in provenance sentence
/// (<see cref="Objectives"/>), the Sky bags/leftover bands (<see cref="RenderLeftoverBands"/>),
/// the session-only band folds (<see cref="BandOpen"/>), the Ready-unlocked caveat
/// (<see cref="RenderReadyBand"/>) and the Alt+Tab-reachable Sky commands
/// (<see cref="SkyAchievementsPrompt"/>). Each is asserted from
/// <c>tests/EQBuddy.E2E</c> through <see cref="DebugFacts"/>, and the shell reports the
/// SAME strings under a <c>shellQuests*</c> prefix so the two hosts cannot disagree.
///
/// **What is NEW here, and it is one thing:** <see cref="SinglePane"/>. Below
/// <c>ShellLayoutPolicy.SplitRoomWidth</c> a list+detail room has to become one pane with
/// a way back, and this surface is the first consumer of an axis that has been decided and
/// unexercised since PR 1. It is off by default, so the window's arrangement is untouched.
