/// <summary>
/// THE UNDER-BAR PANEL (OE-1) — one tracker's detail, drawn directly beneath the collapsed
/// HUD bar, in a companion window slaved to the bar's position.
///
/// **Why a companion window and not a panel inside the widget — this is the whole shape of
/// the feature.** The obvious reading of "expand under the bar" is a panel in the widget's
/// own visual tree, and that is the one thing trap 12 / #173 forbids: the widget is
/// <c>SizeToContent</c>, so a body that appears on a HOVER or grows on a TIMER is a
/// geometry change on an always-on-top transparent window stacked over a fullscreen game.
/// That mechanism cost KoboldCoterie EverQuest's keyboard. <see cref="HudChipRowWindow"/>
/// (Surface A / SA-2, Helm-signed 2026-09-05) is the precedent and this is the second user
/// of it: same chrome family, same <see cref="HudChipRow.Placement"/> arithmetic, and the
/// same default — **slaved, with no geometry of its own.** Where it goes is recomputed from
/// the widget every tick, so there is no saved position to go stale and nothing for a
/// <c>Closed</c> handler to record (trap 2).
///
/// **OE-8 gives it a park and OE-1b lock 3 gives it a width, and both are the PLAYER's.**
/// <c>AppSettings.HudPanelParkLeft</c>/<c>Top</c> and <c>HudPanelWidth</c> are NaN until a
/// drag ends, and NaN means "slaved" and "the OE-7 width" respectively — so a reset profile
/// is today's app by construction, with no migration to run twice (trap 55). Both are written
/// at the END of a gesture and by nothing else: of trap 49's three actors, only the player's
/// has an end. The grip is the whole box (lock 1), the two vertical edges resize (lock 3),
/// and <see cref="HudDragGrip"/> holds the first while <see cref="OnEdgePress"/> claims the
/// press before it on an edge.
///
/// **The motion is a RenderTransform, deliberately** (owner lock 10 — "slick, smooth,
/// professional"). A <see cref="ScaleTransform"/> is post-layout: it changes what is painted
/// and never what is measured, so a 160 ms grow-down animates the panel without asking the
/// window manager to resize anything sixty times a second. Animating the window's own Height
/// would have been the same #173 mechanism one window over.
///
/// **Built in code, not XAML**, like <see cref="HudChipRowWindow"/> and
/// <see cref="ClickThroughChip"/>: there is no designer surface here worth a BAML pair, and
/// an incremental WPF build can leave a stale assembly with a fresh timestamp (trap 18),
/// which is a hazard a code-built window does not carry.
