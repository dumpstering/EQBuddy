///
/// **Lifted out of <c>MainWindow</c> in the same change that re-shaped it**, because that is
/// the only way this change could land: the <c>MainWindow*</c> ratchet had ONE line of
/// headroom (4,221 of 4,222) after OE-1's own lift, so a density rewrite in place was not
/// available at any size. It is the <c>WatchCardView</c> move for the same reason — a
/// surface concentrated in one render, whose behaviour is pinned in <c>tests/EQBuddy.E2E</c>
/// (<c>buffChips</c>, <c>buffWrapped</c>, <c>buffRows</c>) before the move, since the WPF
/// layer has no unit tests (docs/TestPlan.md §5) and that assertion is the only thing
/// standing between a lift and a silent regression.
///
/// **The chips are a <see cref="WrapPanel"/>, never a horizontal <see cref="StackPanel"/>**
/// (trap 25): a stack measures with infinite width in the stacking direction, so the chips
/// past the card's edge would be silently CLIPPED — no ellipsis, no overflow, simply not on
/// screen, which is exactly how a quarter of the Progress tab strip went missing.
///
/// What the card draws, and what stays with the window: the roster, the set line and the
/// suggestion rows are here; the card's VISIBILITY, its expander and its header count are
/// the window's, because a lifted view brings its content and leaves the chrome behind
