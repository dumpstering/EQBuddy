/// <summary>
/// A CHIP ROW's host (Surface A / SA-2; split in two by DRA-352 D1) — a companion window
/// slaved to the HUD's position, carrying its row's deadline chicklets.
///
/// **TWO INSTANCES SINCE D1** (Founder-directed 2026-09-23: "separate respawn from mez").
/// <see cref="HudRowKind.Fight"/> is <c>MainWindow._hudChips</c> — the SA-2 window, its
/// title, its settings — and carries mez &amp; slow, watch alerts and buffs;
/// <see cref="HudRowKind.Spawn"/> is <c>MainWindow._spawnChips</c> and carries respawn
/// countdowns only, with its own park pair and grow flag. One class, parameterized by the
/// row, because a near-copy of this file is the #122/#152 mechanism the fold below retired.
/// Which family goes where is <see cref="HudChipRow.RowOf"/>'s, and both windows draw
/// shares of ONE <see cref="HudChipRow.Build"/> (trap 4).
///
/// It replaces <c>SpawnChipsWindow</c> and <c>MezChipsWindow</c>: two always-on-top floats,
/// two saved positions, two grow-up settings, two near-copies of one renderer.
///
/// **Why a companion window rather than a panel inside the widget.** B3's ruling says "one
/// chip row inside the HUD (expanded state)"; drawn literally inside the widget's visual
/// tree, a chip arriving at spawn-due is a TIMER-DRIVEN RESIZE of a <c>SizeToContent</c>
/// always-on-top window over a fullscreen game — trap 12 / #173's exact mechanism, which
/// cost EverQuest its keyboard on X11. The slaved companion keeps every player-visible
/// property the sign wanted (one row, one place, moves with the HUD, no fourth
/// independently-positioned float, no saved x/y) and leaves the widget's measured size
/// alone. Helm signed the amendment on 2026-09-05.
///
/// **SLAVED BY DEFAULT, AND THAT DEFAULT IS THE WHOLE OF AN UNTOUCHED PROFILE.**
/// <see cref="HudChipRow.Placement"/> recomputes where it goes from the widget every tick.
/// That is what retired <c>ChipStackAnchor</c>, <c>ChipAnchor</c> and eight settings with it:
/// the whole subject of that machinery was persisting a chip stack's own position across
/// reopens, which is where #122 and #152 both lived.
///
/// **OE-8 lets the player PARK it, and deliberately reopens that architecture — on one
/// condition.** <c>AppSettings.HudRowParkLeft</c>/<c>Top</c> is NaN until a player drags the
/// row; NaN is slaved, so a reset or a fresh profile gets the SA-2 app back by construction,
/// with no migration to run twice (trap 55). What made #122/#152 was a window that MOVED
/// ITSELF and rewrote its own anchor as it went; here the anchor has exactly one writer —
/// <see cref="HudDragGrip"/>'s drag end — and neither the follower's tick nor the toolkit's
/// <c>SizeToContent</c> can reach it. Trap 49's three actors, separated by construction
/// rather than by a flag.
///
/// **Visible whenever chips exist, in BOTH HUD states.** The two stacks were visible
/// regardless of whether the widget was minimized — "the stack exists exactly while timers
/// do" — and an expanded-only row would subtract a live capability mid-pass.
///
/// **Built in code, not XAML**, like <see cref="ClickThroughChip"/>: there is no designer
/// surface here worth a BAML pair, and an incremental WPF build can leave a stale assembly
/// with a fresh timestamp (trap 18), which is a hazard a code-built window does not carry.
