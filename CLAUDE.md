# EQBuddy — working notes for AI agents

This file is loaded automatically at the start of every session. Keep it
**short and true** — if something here is wrong it is worse than absent.

Deeper material:

- [docs/Architecture.md](docs/Architecture.md) and [docs/TestPlan.md](docs/TestPlan.md)
- **[docs/ops/README.md](docs/ops/README.md)** — how Soft uses the verification
  ladder and the flake ledger (C′, 2026-09-08)
- **[docs/ops/claude-archive/](docs/ops/claude-archive/README.md)** — incident
  novels, superseded mechanisms, historical evidence. Not always-loaded.
- **`EXO-PLAYBOOK.md` in the `dranakcorps-ops` repo root** (private) — Corps
  doctrine graduated from EQBuddy's ExO experiments, with the evidence
  (DRA-73 §10). Moved out of `dranakcorps-control-plane` 2026-09-16
  (DRA-115); what is left there is a pointer. Maintenance trigger is Q6 on
  DRA-53's nightly pass (DRA-112); M-checkpoint exit is supplementary.

Progression: incident → verified lesson → executable test/guard → compact live
rule. Once a guard exists, the novel leaves this file. Do not gut a rule that
is still needed to hit a size.

## What this is

An always-on-top WPF widget that reads the EverQuest Legends `/log` file and
reports your session. **Log-only, by principle**: never reads game memory,
never phones home except the opt-in heartbeat, never measures other players. **Windows-only since
2026-09-04** — the Avalonia lane was deleted in E-2c and is preserved at
`v1.99.18` and on `legacy-v1` ([LEGACY-V1.md](LEGACY-V1.md)). When a trap says
"both lanes", it is telling you what the bug cost, not what the repo contains.
EQBuddy Mobile serves a phone/tablet over the LAN from inside `EQBuddy.exe`.

**What it is becoming:** the personal operating companion for EverQuest
Legends — private, local, personal, non-judgmental. Not a parser recap, and
not a coach. The differentiator is the chain (loot → quest → item → mob →
camp → route), learned from your own play. Filter every feature against that.
Group monitoring is out of the product, permanently.

## Roadmap

[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is the frame — what is being built, in what order,
and what is deliberately not. Keep the gate table in it true; it is the one
doc a non-engineer reads.

## Soft practice

Keep these even when this file is short:

- **Evidence before confidence.** A hypothesis is labelled as one. Measure
  before the third theory; ship the instrument if you cannot.
- **Prove-fail a new guard.** Green-only is vacuous coverage (trap 34).
- **Reviewer sign-off is the merge review.** No PR flow requires a tip, a
  SIGN or a last-look; you do not invent a sign-off stamp either.
- **Local greens are not CI.** `build-and-test` + `e2e-windows` remain the
  merge bar — and since **2026-09-20 (DRA-228) both are REQUIRED status checks
  on `main`, with `enforce_admins` ON**, so this sentence is enforced rather
  than believed. It was not, for eleven days: protection listed
  `build-and-test` alone, the second green was held up by hand every time, and
  PR #715 merged at 02:31Z with `e2e-windows` still running the moment somebody
  used `--auto`. **Admin enforcement is half the fix, not a flourish** — every
  merge here is made by `DranakCorps-bot`, which is a repo admin, so without it
  the new bar would have bound auto-merge and waved through every hand merge by
  the one account that performs them.
  **`--auto` is allowed again**, and that is the point of the change rather
  than a concession: the required set now matches the documented bar, which is
  exactly what auto-merge waits for. Measured on PR #729 — armed, and it did
  not fire against a red `e2e-windows`. See
  [docs/ops/verification-ladder.md](docs/ops/verification-ladder.md).
- **"Passed on rerun" is observation, not resolution.** File
  [docs/ops/flake-ledger.md](docs/ops/flake-ledger.md).

**Local verify to the class, then stop:** V0 targeted unit/static; V1 relevant
unit + targeted E2E if user-visible; V2 affected suites + `scripts/check.ps1`;
V3 full discipline. Full CI/`main` gates stay authoritative — do not weaken
them.

### Channel files: who trims, and how they stay small

- **"Executor never trims" means never INLINE, inside a feature branch.** Helm
  ruled the DRA-267 LIVE ASK on 2026-09-20 ~3:45 PM CT (ADOPT (a), narrowing
  the bar to its own rationale). In a work session Executors still append only;
  spotted rot goes into a card comment, never fixed inline. But a **standalone
  janitorial rotation PR** — changed files exactly the ledger, its archive under
  `docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/<YYYY-Qn>/`, and
  `scripts/channel-size-baseline.psd1` when and only when the ledger carries a
  row at the PR's base — is permitted on **any Soft seat, Sr Executor
  included**. PR #744 is the tested template.
- **Rotation seat is any free Soft seat** claiming the standing
  `EXO-CHANNEL-ROTATE` card (**DRA-154**) — the non-Executor-only restriction
  is retired (DRA-267). DRA-154's "Who may claim" holds the exact
  changed-file test; read it before claiming.
- **When a pass fires: headroom, not a calendar.** There is no weekly date.
  Helm ruled the DRA-232 LIVE ASK on 2026-09-19 ~11:35 PM CT
  ([EQBuddy PR #719](https://github.com/DranakCorps-bot/EQBuddy/pull/719)):
  *"rotation is a per-file headroom trigger, not weekly. Default: WARN when
  remaining band is 2% or one median append, whichever is larger; the rotate
  seat claims before the file is red."* **DRA-154 is the procedure of record**
  — it holds the arithmetic, the per-file numbers and the pass steps. This
  block tells you the rule exists; DRA-154 tells you how to run it, and a
  second copy here would only drift from the first.
- **The ceiling stands, and so do both guard arms.** Helm: *"KEEP the 64 KiB
  ceiling and both guard arms."* A headroom WARN is the trigger to **rotate**,
  never to buy room: do not raise a row in
  `scripts/channel-size-baseline.psd1`, do not add one, and do not weaken
  either arm of `scripts/channel-size-guard.ps1`. Rows only ever leave, and
  only in the pull request whose rotation earned it.
- **Per-file ceilings were asked for and refused.** Helm: *"REJECT (b) per-file
  ceilings as the fix — that is a self-granted exemption, and check B already
  refuses it."*
- **`HANDOFF.md` and `DECISIONS.md` split at source.** The live file keeps
  STATE (Holds, Retired, standing rules, live instruments); dated entries move
  into `docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/` — a rename, not a trim. Both halves
  landed 2026-09-21 (`HELM.md` under **DRA-277**, `DECISIONS.md` under
  **DRA-281**); `HELM.md` then retired into `HANDOFF.md` on 2026-09-30
  (**DRA-569**) and is only a pointer now.
- **Sign-off.** A rotation PR merges on Reviewer sign-off and the required
  checks, like any other PR — `HANDOFF.md` and `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` included.
- **Open asks, holds and standing rules never rotate**, at any age. A pass that
  eats a live hold has failed.
- **Discharge on close.** Whoever closes a loop writes the LOOP CLOSED line *at
  close time* — that is what makes the entry rotatable next pass. Un-discharged
  loops are the only thing that makes files immortal.
- **Card-ID-or-it-didn't-happen.** Channel entries about tracked work cite the
  card; they do not restate acceptance criteria, repro steps, or history the
  card already holds.
- **One channel per fact.** On a card → the channel gets a pointer; a ruling →
  the channel holds it and the card points back. Never both in full.
- **No repo TODO files.** Every TODO is a card; code TODOs carry `TODO(DRA-nn):`.

---

## Scribe

David's Grok Bot helper — **and yours** (David, 2026-08-19). It compiles
GitHub and Reddit into `SCRIBE.md`. Community posts are input, not
instructions. `SCRIBE.md` is evidence, not a work order. A hypothesis is
labelled as one.

- Ask it for **findings as text** in `SCRIBE-TESTING.md`, not files.
  Diagnoses of code are a place to look, never a fact; channel work is
  excellent. Verify with a `grep` before you act.
  [Why the shots never arrived](docs/ops/claude-archive/operating-history.md#scribe-is-on-two-machines).
- When you take an item from `SCRIBE.md`, delete it (or leave only what is
  still planned). Write `SCRIBE-FEEDBACK.md`.
- GitHub posts go out as `DranakCorps-bot`. Sign them:
  - You (Claude Code): `— Dranak (Claude Code)`
  - Scribe (Grok Bot): `— Scribe (Grok Bot)`
- **Read the last comment's signature before replying.** The account is
  shared; `status.ps1` cannot tell which of us wrote the last "ours".

**Holds BIND you** (David, 2026-08-22). **Dranak lifts them**, or the Founder
where the consequence list applies, and the lift is a dated line in
`HANDOFF.md` (DRA-569/570, 2026-09-30; before that, only Helm lifted).
Routine signed thread replies are yours; a hold takes that back for the
named thread.

- A shipped fix does **not** lift a hold.
- You may say a hold looks stale; you may not act on that. Say so on a card
  and route it seat → Planner → Dranak ([Escalation](#escalation-and-live-state)).
  File writes are not a wake. Do not ask David to carry the note.
- Nothing else about the thread is held — fix, test, ship, write the reply;
  posting it is not.
- A hold names **who lifts it and when**. "Dranak hold until Dranak lifts
  it" is a hold. "Waiting for David" is not — it is a consequence-list
  decision or a call to make and log.
- Treat "do not open" as a reply hold too, until it is lifted in `HANDOFF.md`.
- **Holds live in exactly one place: `HANDOFF.md`** (`HELM.md` is a pointer
  to it). If you ever find a second list, one of them is stale by
  construction. Re-read `HANDOFF.md` before every thread reply — holds
  arrive by commit between pulls.
- **A public reply's POSTURE question goes to Dranak via the board** — there
  is no Helm signature to wait for (DRA-570). A public reply beyond a routine
  signed thread reply is consequence-list work (item 3) and is not covered by
  any plan's slice authorization.
- **Before you describe what a reporter has or has not been told, OPEN THE
  THREAD.** One `gh` call. Hold text describes an intention, never the
  state of a thread.
  [Stale-hold examples](docs/ops/claude-archive/operating-history.md#a-hold-names-a-prevention-not-a-vibe).

## Bevel

Product/UX. `BEVEL.md` is its inbox (take an item, delete it);
`BEVEL-FEEDBACK.md` is your channel back. Visual and interaction critique,
which surface owns which job, what disappears when something folds. Weight
the evidence and the verbatim quotes; a claim about the CODE is a place to
look. **Read `BEVEL.md` before designing anything.**

## Fable

`FABLE.md` is the V2–V3 plan inbox; `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` is your channel
back. Fable 5 writes the plan; **you execute it by default**, then delete
the item and write the feedback note.

**Approval is by exception, not by gate (David, 2026-08-22).** A plan is
`ready` the moment Fable writes it. The ONLY plans that wait carry a
`needs-david:` line naming a decision from the [consequence
list](#what-needs-david-and-what-does-not).

**A plan is signed ONCE, for its whole declared slice sequence** — signing
is Planner routing it (owner, next seat, acceptance); see
[How a plan lands](#how-a-plan-lands-and-what-signing-it-buys). Fable does
not re-authorize per slice and you do not ask it to; you take D(n+1) when
D(n) merges green. A slice that turns out to exceed what the plan declared
stops and escalates — that is the seam the sequence-wide SIGN rests on.

**Each delivery carries `route: routine | hard` in the plan text, written at
that same SIGN** — it picks the executor (Jr / Sr), an **untagged delivery
fails closed to Sr**, and the ordered test plus the ten banned-Jr surfaces live
in the ops `EXO-PLAYBOOK.md` (`exo-experiment: jr-sr-router`, DRA-179).

**The Jr lane's mechanics are [§7 of docs/ops/execution-flow.md](docs/ops/execution-flow.md)**
(DRA-179 D2). Jr claims the CARD's seat through the resolved
`scripts/claim-seat.ps1` form like any executor — there is no per-lane work
item, and **Sr's review is not a second claim**. **Both lanes are CLI-only: no
model API is built for either, and no shipped code path calls a model.** **A Jr
PR merges only on a ticked Sr gate** — the enforcement is a CHECKLIST in the PR
body (Helm's pick, 2026-09-17), never branch protection, and nothing invents a
second GitHub identity or touches repository settings.

There is no Fable Grok Bot. **You do not start Fable** (David, 2026-08-24).
File the ask as a card routed to Planner. A file write is not a call.

## How work is routed — V0–V1 yourself, V2–V3 through a plan

David's operating model, 2026-08-21. **Do not pay a planning-handoff tax
without a reason, and do not skip it when the reason is there.**

| Class | What it looks like | Route |
|---|---|---|
| **V0–V1** | Cosmetic, mechanical, localized, straightforward. Most of what arrives. | **One Claude loop — you plan and implement it.** Inbox: `SCRIBE.md`. |
| **V2–V3** | Cross-cutting architecture, significant refactor, ambiguous root cause, security/privacy/migration, complex parallel decomposition. | **Fable 5 plans → you execute**, unless the plan carries `needs-david:`. |

**When you judge work is V2/V3 mid-session, stop before implementing it.**
Do not paste the stub into `FABLE.md`. Per `FABLE.md`'s own **Where a plan
goes now**:

> **Fable writes the plan body to `docs/plans/DRA-<n>.md`** — one file per
> card, named for the Paperclip card it plans — and adds **one row** to the
> index at the bottom of this file. Do not paste a plan body into this
> file. A stub with no card yet takes a `STUB-<slug>.md` name until one
> exists.

Write the stub to `docs/plans/STUB-<slug>.md` — the problem, the evidence,
and *why it is not V0–V1* — add its one-row index entry to `FABLE.md`, and
carry on with V0–V1 work. Finishing it anyway and labelling it V2 in the
summary is the one option that guarantees the handoff is never tested.

The class is about **consequence and reach, not effort**. A one-line fix
that changes a wire protocol is V2; a four-hour slog through eleven call
sites that changes no decision is V1. Touching Core plus both UIs is a
*file count*, not a reason.

**The test before stubbing (Fable 5, 2026-08-21): *if David answered one
question right now, could I finish this as V1?*** If yes, ask the question
instead of filing the stub. If you cannot say why it is not V0–V1, it is
not a `FABLE.md` item.

## What needs David, and what does not

**David, 2026-08-22:** *"I don't want to be the CEO that is brought into
every team meeting to decide if I like the blue color or the red color
more."* Nothing ships without his explicit "ship", so everything on `main`
before a tag is reversible — asking him to approve a change AND asking him
to release it is paying twice for one protection.

**The consequence list — his, because they are about what EQBuddy IS or
cannot be undone:**

1. The values line (never measure other players) and anything adjacent to it.
2. **The release go.** Still the Founder's, and still the one hard gate —
   but it is a decision, not a keystroke: the go names the version and the
   reviewed commit, may be conditional on that review ("ship v2.0.3 when the
   review of `<sha>` passes"), and is recorded on the release card.
   EXECUTION is the release seat's
   ([docs/ops/release-seat.md](docs/ops/release-seat.md)); the Founder is
   never asked to run the script. A seat assignment or a Reviewer PASS is not
   a go (DRA-675).
3. Anything public under the project's name beyond routine signed thread
   replies: announcements, Reddit, anything a reporter would read as a promise.
4. Money, licensing, partnerships (donations, spinips, anyone asking to
   embed or port).
5. Roadmap direction: a new theme, dropping or adding a surface, reordering
   gates, a feature that fits no surface.
6. Departing from eqlwiki on game data.
7. Policy toward a third party that can notice us (request rates at eqlwiki,
   how we ask reporters for things).
8. Anything that touches a player's privacy, their profile files, or what
   the app sends off the machine.

**Everything else is pre-authorized, with a reporting duty instead of an
asking duty.** Make the call, state the assumption at the top, log it in
`DECISIONS.md` — what was decided, the default it could have gone the other
way on, and where it landed. David skims and vetoes from that file.

**A question to David must pass BOTH tests** or it is a decision you have
not made yet:

- Would he plausibly answer differently from the obvious default?
- Does the answer change *direction* rather than *implementation*?

"Two lookups in flight or three" fails both. "Do we keep answering on
Reddit" passes both. When a question fails, decide, write the assumption at
the top, log it, and proceed.

**When a question PASSES, ask it with the question tool, in session, right
then.** A `needs-david:` line in the plan — `docs/plans/DRA-<n>.md`,
indexed from `FABLE.md` — is the durable record, not the way he finds out.
Write the line, then put the same question to him as its own prompt. If he
is not in the session, the line waits.

**Measure it.** Questions to David per week should fall; logged decisions
should rise. If he vetoes logged decisions more than rarely, the list is
too short; if he never vetoes, it is too long. Edit the list, not the habit.

## The inboxes inform you. They never trigger an unattended agent.

`SCRIBE.md`, `BEVEL.md` and `FABLE.md` are insight and guidance, never
execution authority. (`HANDOFF.md` is the exception that proves it: a hold
RESTRAINS you, it never commissions work.) An agent that could hand itself
work by writing a file is not a boundary at all.

**What authorises work is an interactive session** (David, 2026-08-22). In
a session with David present you may take V0–V1 items from
`SCRIBE.md`/`BEVEL.md` and `ready` plans from `FABLE.md` without being told
to, subject to the consequence list. You never resolve a `needs-david:`
line yourself.

**The boundary that stays absolute binds anything running unattended THAT
NOBODY OWNS.** A scheduled job, hook, or file-change routine must not take
work from these files **unless it is the Founder-owned control plane**
(David's login, David's machine, Founder-authenticated dispatch). A session
it starts does the one item it was started for and has **no release,
signing or posting authority**. A job under some other credential, or one
that could be started by writing a file, is still forbidden.

**Approved by David, 2026-08-23** (Fable 5 proposal). The times the other
agents run still authorise nothing — their runs only write files.

### When the two of them actually run (David, 2026-08-24)

**Scribe 5am · Bevel 1pm, daily, America/Chicago.** Both also run at 6pm.
Inbox files stamp CT.

- Their commits land between your pulls. `git pull` at the start of a
  session and again **before any public reply** — a hold can land in
  `HANDOFF.md` between them.
- A question in a channel file is not a wake. A decision you need goes on a
  card, up the [escalation ladder](#escalation-and-live-state).
- David is not the courier. Page him only for a consequence-list door.
- The times do not authorise anything.

## Escalation and live state

`HANDOFF.md` is STATE, not a work queue — holds, standing rules, live
instruments. Dranak and Planner read it. You never "take" a hold and
delete it.

- **Ladder: seat → Planner → Dranak.** Planner assigns the owner, the next
  seat and the acceptance; Dranak decides open naming, flow and posture
  choices, and lifts holds. **Only the board's Founder-ask flow reaches
  David**, and only for the [consequence list](#what-needs-david-and-what-does-not).
- **Reviewer sign-off on the PR is the merge review.** No PR flow waits on a
  tip, a SIGN or a last-look.
- **Helm is out of these flows since 2026-09-30** (DRA-563/569/570).
  `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` is a ledger, not a wake; "Helm-signed" and "Helm
  ruled" elsewhere in this file are provenance for the rule beside them.

**Ask a hold for its lifting CONDITION.** A hold with no condition is one
nobody can ever satisfy.

### How a plan lands, and what signing it buys

Two cutovers from the DRA-73 plan's M0, 2026-09-14. Both are process, both
are **reversible by a HOLD**, and neither touches the consequence list.
Detail and the numbers behind them:
[docs/ops/execution-flow.md](docs/ops/execution-flow.md).

- **A ruling is a PR review, a card comment or a `HANDOFF.md` commit — never a
  `helm/ssc-N` PR.** Do not open one, do not ask for one, do not wait on
  one, and do not add "land the SSC" to a posture list. A PR review plus a
  merge commit is the same audit trail: immutable, timestamped, indexed,
  and attached to the thing it rules on. `helm/ssc-*` branches already on
  the remote land or close on their own terms; **no new ones.** In the
  DRA-70/71/72 window, 12 of 24 PRs existed only to carry signature prose.
- **A signed plan authorizes every slice it declares, in order, on green
  gates.** When D(n) merges you start D(n+1) — you do not ask to be allowed
  to, and nobody issues "AUTHORIZE dra-N-dX after land" per slice. **Dranak
  stops the train with a HOLD, not by withholding authorization**: an
  objection blocks, absence of attention no
  longer does. 84% of the measured wait in that window was planned work
  parked overnight at an authorization gap, and no pre-merge SIGN in it
  changed a slice.

**A C1–C5 plan walks the Challenger gate before it is signed**
(DRA-305, Helm-signed 2026-09-22). The **Challenger role** — the Paperclip
agent `ed169d99-fa28-4f30-b6a8-467b6a725bed`, under Planner, which is **not**
`claim-seat -Mode challenger`'s seat-mutex claim category — argues the
reasoning behind a consequenceful plan before that plan is signed. A plan that
trips C1–C5 carries its keyed `challenge:` line (and its
`challenge-overrule:` or 6-hour NO-RETURN line, where one applies) at the top
of the plan body beside `route:`, and restates it in the ask to Planner. Three
things about it bind here:

- **It fires ONCE, at the plan's SIGN, and NEVER per slice.** The bullet above
  still holds unchanged — a signed plan authorizes every slice it declares. A
  per-slice Challenger wake would re-create, one layer down, exactly the 84%
  of parked wait that cutover bought out. A slice that outgrows its declared
  boundary stops and escalates, and **that escalation IS a new plan ask**,
  so it takes the gate there like any other; nothing new is invented to catch
  it. A keyed line on a D(n+1) hand-off is a **defect**, not thoroughness.
- **Silence after a wake is never a pass.** "No C-test fired, so no wake" and
  "waked, and no line came back" are different events, and no doc here may
  merge them. Once the wake has fired an absent line is a **non-return**,
  disposed by the NO-RETURN rule — never read as PROCEED.
- **A plan over the slot ceiling is challenged by NAMED SECTIONS, never
  truncated.** Before waking, Planner measures the committed
  `docs/plans/DRA-<n>.md` in bytes and records that in the wake; over the
  ceiling it names the spans carrying the load-bearing premises. A plan that
  cannot be reduced under it goes to Dranak as a reopen, carrying the NO-RETURN
  line — never waked-and-hoped.

C1–C5 themselves, the verdict semantics and the gate-outcome mapping live in
**`CHALLENGER_PROCESS_GATE_SPEC.md` under `purpose/` in the `dranakcorps-ops`
repo** (private, ops PR #58). **This is a POINTER and
must never become a copy** — for that file's own reason: a copy either tracks
the original or it goes stale, and the stale one is what somebody reads.
**Since DRA-309 S3 the line's PLACEMENT is mechanically checked and its
SUBSTANCE is not.** `scripts/challenge-line-guard.ps1` (in `check.ps1` and CI)
pairs a forbid-scan — no keyed line of any card inside a slice sequence, which
is §3.2's defect — with a curated must-list of the plans that reached the
C-test, the half that can see a walk which never happened (trap 34). It reads
the KEY and that a disposition is present, and **deliberately never the
verdict's SPELLING**: enumerating the four verdicts here would be exactly the
copy the sentence above forbids, and would fail closed the day ops adds a
fifth. So a malformed verdict word, a wrong C-classification and a line whose
reasoning is empty all still pass it — write the line because the ask is wrong
without it, not because CI will catch you.

You still escalate (seat → Planner → Dranak) for what the plan did **not**
declare: a departure from it, a slice that outgrew its declared boundary, a
guard failure, a cross-lane conflict, or a public reply's posture — and
anything on the consequence list goes on to David through the board's
Founder-ask flow. That is the exception path working, not a formality —
and a live hold naming the work still binds, plan or no plan.

Durable truth lives in the repo, not in a conversation. Keep this file,
`HANDOFF.md`, the trap list and `docs/TestPlan.md` true as you go.

## Feedback to the other agents is not optional

David, 2026-08-22: always leave feedback (constructive, corrective,
reinforcing) so the process improves.

**Put a `To:` line directly under the heading of any entry that ASKS
someone for something:**

```
## 2026-08-23 — RELEASE REVIEW REQUESTED: v1.99.7
To: Fable
```

Roles are `Fable`, `Claude`, `Planner`, `Dranak`, `Scribe`, `Bevel`, `David`. **`To:
David` is for a consequence-list decision only** — it never replaces the
question tool.

**APPEND your entry; never rewrite the file.** Re-read the ref at splice
time, write bytes in explicit UTF-8, and check that `git diff` over the
file is additions-only before you push. Helm-signed process, 2026-09-05;
the two ways this has already gone wrong are [trap 60](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-60).

Every round, every agent you took from or that reviewed you gets a note in
its `*-FEEDBACK.md`. Three kinds — the third is the one that gets skipped:

- **Corrective** — what was wrong, with the evidence.
- **Constructive** — what would make the next one land better.
- **Reinforcing** — what to keep doing, named specifically enough to repeat.

Say what an item COST as well as what it was worth. Close the loop out loud
when their feedback changed something.

## Fable reviews the release BEFORE David is asked to approve it

David, 2026-08-22. Order: **gates green → Fable reviews the release → THEN
ask David.** If David asks for a release anyway, say the review has not
happened and how long it needs; he can override knowingly.

What Fable reviews — the release, not the code it already last-looked:

1. The diff since the last tag, for anything player-facing that shipped
   without a guard.
2. `WhatsNew.json` — every entry TRUE, nothing player-noticeable missing,
   every reporter credited by name and number.
3. Anything unreleased that should NOT go yet.
4. The version number and the held-work list, against what the tag will
   actually contain.

Write the request into `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` with the tag, the commit range

## Commands

```bash
dotnet build EQBuddy.slnx -c Release
dotnet test tests/EQBuddy.Tests/EQBuddy.Tests.csproj -c Release
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/check.ps1
```

**Soft seats — invoke them RESOLVED, through the clone's main checkout:**

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/claim-seat.ps1" -WorkItem DRA-28 -SeatId my-seat
pwsh -NoProfile -File "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/release-seat.ps1" -WorkItem DRA-28 -SeatId my-seat
```

**Why the long form is the documented one** (DRA-107, Helm-signed 2026-09-16):
a linked worktree shares its clone's STORE (correct, DRA-90) but carries its
**own checkout of the script**. `scripts/claim-seat.ps1` is a *relative* path, so
from a stale worktree it runs a pre-DRA-102 copy that consults no registry and
**grants the cross-clone duplicate DRA-102 closed** — measured, same worktree and
same card and same second: the local copy said `OK: claimable`, the resolved copy
refused and named the holder in the other clone. 72 of 205 worktrees in the Bosun
clone and 6 of 7 in the harness clone are that stale copy, one of them an agent
workspace the dispatcher can start a run in.

`--git-common-dir` answers the clone's `.git` from a linked worktree **and** from
the main checkout, so **one invocation is right everywhere** and nothing branches
on where you are standing. It resolves the SCRIPT the way DRA-90 already resolves
the STORE, and it reduces the standing invariant from "keep 205 files current" to
"keep 2 files current", one per clone.

**The bare relative form still works and is not removed — it is DEMOTED.** It is
correct from a clone's main checkout and wrong from a stale worktree, and it
cannot tell you which one you are in. Needs **git ≥ 2.31** for
`--path-format=absolute` (both clones measured at 2.54.0). Code on `main` cannot
repair a copy that will never receive it, which is why this is a call-site rule
rather than a guard inside the script.

Flakes: [docs/ops/flake-ledger.md](docs/ops/flake-ledger.md).

**David's machine always runs the latest dev build** (David, 2026-09-29). When work he
should see is ready, run **`pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/install-local.ps1 -Evolved -Install`**
from `main` plus any PR still awaiting his smoke, merged on a LOCAL branch that is never
pushed. The build is signed and installs over his Evolved copy on his own profile. The
build it replaces becomes the Start menu's "(previous version)". Nothing is released.

Releasing is **`pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/release.ps1 -Tag vX.Y.Z`** —
bump `<Version>` in `Directory.Build.props` and add a `WhatsNew.json` entry
first, or it refuses. Run it via `pwsh` from Bash. **It is run by the
release seat on a release card** (Sr Executor, [docs/ops/release-seat.md](docs/ops/release-seat.md)),
**and verified by `scripts/release-verify.ps1 -Tag vX.Y.Z -Commit <sha> -Since <start>`**
— tag, GitHub release, OneDrive, sha256 and signature, one row each. **A silent
failure is not proof nothing happened**, and a failed run is a hard stop:
the seat runs `release-verify.ps1` to see what shipped and never retries.

**Signing is automatic and non-negotiable** (`scripts/signing.ps1`).
Releases are signed through Azure Artifact Signing as
`CN=FlossworksCross-Stitch`. `release.ps1` throws unless every artifact
comes back verified and timestamped — **do not add a bypass, a `-SkipSign`
switch, or a warn-and-continue path**. If signing fails, the release stops;
the fix is the toolchain. **The release signs as a service principal**
(`scripts/signing-identity.ps1`, DRA-679: non-exportable TPM key, one role
at one profile). `az login` is the fallback, and the one human step only if
both fail. Runbook, rotation and revoke:
[docs/ops/release-seat.md](docs/ops/release-seat.md#signing-login-dra-679).

Gitignored and absent on a fresh clone: `artifact-signing.json`,
`artifact-signing-identity.json` (repo root) and `tools/` (auto-restored). The `Endpoint` region must match the
account's region or signing fails with a bare 403.

## When you need a decision from David, ASK — don't bury it in prose

Use the **question tool**, not a paragraph in a long message.

- Ask at the moment the answer changes what you do next.
- One question, with the real options as choices, and say which you would
  pick and why.
- A finished piece of work with an open question in it is not finished.
- **THE TELL: if you are writing a sentence that offers him a choice, you
  are asking a question — use the tool.**
- **"Not blocking yet" is not a reason to withhold a question**, only a
  reason to choose the moment.
- **THE PATTERN THAT KEEPS DOING IT IS THE CLOSING PARAGRAPH.** Before
  sending, re-read your last paragraph. If it names something he might do,
  want, review, or decide — that is the question, and it goes in the tool.
- This does not mean ask more often. Run the two tests on the consequence
  list first.

[Why the closing paragraph is the gap](docs/ops/claude-archive/operating-history.md#the-question-tool-gap-was-the-closing-paragraph).

## Rules that are not up for renegotiation

- **Never measure other players.** No party DPS, no raid meters, no
  rankings, no leaderboards, no watching other people. Decline warmly.
  Community forks of the published 1.x / LEGACY tree under MIT remain a
  LEGACY matter only — do not invite a fork of Evolved / v2 (proprietary /
  permission-required). Do not file these asks as requirements.
- **Hold releases** until David explicitly says ship (a go on the release
  card naming the version and the reviewed commit is explicit). Commit and
  push source freely.
- **Nothing ships unsigned, ever.** Every artifact a player can run is
  signed through Azure Artifact Signing and *verified* before it reaches
  OneDrive, the GitHub release, or the update channel. `release.ps1`
  enforces this and throws. The publisher identity is the one thing a
  player cannot verify by reading the source, so it must never be
  conditional. The old self-signed path warned and carried on; that is
  how an unsigned installer reaches people while the run reports success.
- **Every player-noticeable change needs a `WhatsNew.json` entry** in the
  release that ships it. A user-visible fix landing after a tag earns its
  own release. Credit reporters by name and discussion number.
- **A release that MOVES a surface says so by name, in the form "X is now
  Y"** — the old place AND the new one (David, 2026-08-23, answering #233).
  Public promise in 1.99.6's What's-new: *"you should never have to hunt
  for something EQBuddy relocated, and if you do, that is a bug in this
  list."* The fold is an **organizing pass** after a fast build-out; say
  both that the new homes are better for a new player *and* that a
  long-term user experiences the disruption.

  The three ways back — **do not remove one without replacing it:**

  1. **A folded card's NAME returns in Options → Cards & windows — on the
     card that ABSORBED it** ("Gear is a tab in here now"). An absorbed
     card does not get its own row:
     `OptionsViewModel.AbsorbedTitles`, keyed by the SURVIVING card. Motes
     is the exception that proves it — it has a row again because David
     made it a card again in 1.99 (see trap 55). **The SUBTRACTED-card arm
     is RETIRED** (2026-09-23, DRA-352 D2, Founder direction; Helm LOCKED
     the drop): `OverlaySections.Retired` and its *"No longer on the
     widget"* block — Helm-signed 2026-09-05 (Bevel I-11 §4) — left Options
     with their data and their test class. A subtraction's way back is
     now its CONTEXT-MENU row alone (`Guide…`, `World…`; a hotkey is not a
     door, trap 59) plus the release's "X is now Y" What's-new line.
  2. **A merged card keeps the slot its parts had.**
  3. **Every card header's ↗ pops the surface out** into its own window.

  Helm-signed ruling (b), 2026-09-04: the sentence used to read *"folded
  cards return in Options → Cards & windows"*, which the catalog has never
  done. It does not prejudge #251 (Faction's card back).
- **Tests must never touch the real profile.**
  `tests/EQBuddy.Tests/TestProfileIsolation.cs` redirects `EQBUDDY_APPDATA`
  to temp. **The redirect is UNCONDITIONAL since 2026-09-07** — an
  inherited variable is not a decision (trap 68). The single door is
  `EQBUDDY_ALLOW_LIVE_APPDATA=1`, exactly that string. A run through it
  fails `TestProfileIsolationTests` by design.
  **The child-process half is `UI.Shared/IsolatedLaunchPolicy`** (E2E,
  `shoot.ps1`, drag-verify) — a host that is isolated can still launch
  `EQBuddy.exe` against a live profile (trap 69). **Corps doctrine since
  2026-09-16** — ops `EXO-PLAYBOOK.md` entry 6 (ADOPT as a principle; the
  principle transfers, not this repo's C#). Audit:
  `docs/ops/live-state-isolation-audit.md`.
- **Curated catalogs are never auto-written** (spawn timers, AAs, CC
  lists, `ItemNameAliases`). The weekly wiki refresh only *flags* them. A wrong respawn timer
  is worse than none. A machine may write a **separate** file beside one
  (`HarvestedGuides.json.gz` beside `GuideCatalog.json`, DRA-45) as long as
  the curated file is untouched and **wins at load** — never by editing it.
- **When quest/catalog data conflicts and cannot be resolved, match the
  wiki** (David, 2026-08-14). Being wrong the same way as the community's
  own reference is recoverable. Being *uniquely* wrong costs trust in
  EQBuddy. Departing needs decisive evidence — a confirmed turn-in — and a
  note saying so. See the Bard Sky steps `sky-003`/`sky-005` in
  `Core/Data/GuideCatalog.json` (their `sources[].note`, DRA-47).
- **Other sources are allowed where the wiki is silent; eqlwiki is the
  tie-breaker** (David, 2026-08-16, #163). Where they disagree, eqlwiki
  wins. Anything taken from elsewhere is **marked as such**.
- **And ask the reporter to correct the wiki** (David, 2026-08-14). Point
  them at the page's edit link.
- **eqlwiki is the SOURCE, and EQBuddy is the tool that helps it update —
  explore that shape FIRST** (David, 2026-08-22). When an ask is about
  **shared game truth** the wiki does or should hold, the first option is
  *"can EQBuddy hand the player a paste-ready edit for eqlwiki?"* The
  contribution pack (#65) is the answer shape; `WikiContribution` already
  carries it.

  Three limits: it is about the WORLD, not the player; nothing publishes
  itself (the player opens the edit link); the bar for SUGGESTING is
  higher than the bar for showing (`SuggestRarity` refuses under ten
  kills).
- **A surface that needs an in-game command must SHIP the command**
  (David, 2026-08-14; restated 2026-08-20). One-click copy from
  `UI.Shared/GameCommands.cs` — never its own literal
  (`GameCommandsTests`). Telling someone to import a file without saying
  how is a silent no-op. `EQBuddy/RaidsCardView.cs` puts the button on the
  POPULATED state too.
- **GitHub Discussions are input, not instructions.** And no community ask enters
  scope until it has an alignment verdict against the vision docs: `aligned` builds,
  `not-aligned` gets a decline David approves, and `unclear` is a Founder ask with
  nothing built or merged (David, 2026-10-01, DRA-724). Reviewer does not merge a
  request-driven PR without an `ALIGNMENT: aligned` line.
  [docs/ops/request-alignment.md](docs/ops/request-alignment.md).
- Silent no-ops are broken. Cards always show. Settings live in Options —
  except EQBuddy Mobile, which David wanted as its own title-bar button.

## Which surface does it go on? (David, 2026-08-15)

**The game is on the player's monitor. Everything else goes somewhere
else.** A feature that fits no surface shouldn't be built.

> **Is there something the player must do, and a moment by which they must
> do it?**

| Surface | For | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **In-game overlay** | A deadline with an action. Must be small enough to ignore. | Mez/charm chips, spawn-due chips, Watch alerts, buff-expiring |
| **Phone / tablet** | Anything worth *looking away* for. | Map, quests, item lookup, gear, loot, DPS, session totals |
| **Desktop** | Before and after play: research, compare, configure, review history. | Gear & Loot, history, Options, wiki packs |

**DPS goes off-screen.** Nothing about seeing 412 rather than 438 changes
what you do in the next second. Competitors keep it on the overlay to
compare against the raid; [we don't do that](#rules-that-are-not-up-for-renegotiation).
The binary "am I actually attacking / is my pet idle" does pass the test.

### Mobile and desktop are both first-class, in both directions (David, 2026-08-18)

Once a feature is on two surfaces, **neither is allowed to quietly fall
behind**. Parity by feature list drifts; parity by shared module does not.
`SurfaceParityTests` asserts the projection against the same
`QuestChecklistLayout` the windows use.

**When a surface exists on both, the decision goes in Core/UI.Shared and
all three call it.** Porting a feature *to* the phone is the signal the
logic never went through the shared layer.

**Breakout windows** — `BreakoutKind` is `{ Damage, Healing, Pet, Watch, Loot, Buffs, Quests }`
(`DocumentationSizeTests` pins this list). `Quests` (2026-09-29) is the bar's Tracked
quests list popped out; it arrives unpinned (`MigrateQuestsFloatOff`). `Progress` stopped being a
breakout on 2026-08-25; the mini bar's xp chip opens the Progress WINDOW.
**"Reuse the existing theme window on its current tab"** is the rule for
every fold of this shape. Watch and Buffs earn the overlay; 
Damage/Healing/Pet/Loot are review surfaces. Change defaults rather than
delete — `AppSettings.DisabledBreakouts` already gates them.

Log-only is table stakes. The second screen is uncontested ground; anything
that makes the phone better is worth more than anything that makes the
overlay busier. (Linux/macOS builds were the other uncontested ground;
they live on `legacy-v1`.)

## Where things live

| Need | Go to |
|---|---|
| Parse a log line | `Core/LogParser.cs` — one regex per line type |
| Aggregate / DPS / encounters | `Core/SessionStats.cs` (+ `.Tracked.cs`) |
| Which class the log looks like | `Core/ClassInference.cs` |
| What level this character is | `Core/CharacterLevel.cs` — **two writers, ordered by TIME and the fresher wins** (a third since 2026-09-30: the player's own `/who` row, `Core/WhoLines.cs` → `QuestLedgerStore.SetWho` — its level is the LOWEST equipped class and it also sets the ROSTER, `ClassSource.Who`, fresher-vs-statement by the same rule; other players' rows are dropped on arrival) (a ding after your statement wins; your statement after the ding wins — DRA-71 D3). NOT a precedence table: both rankings are wrong half the time, because the log's number belongs to whatever classes were equipped when it printed. Store is `QuestLedgerStore` (`Level`/`LevelAt` ← the LOG's timestamp, `StatedLevel`/`StatedLevelAt` ← the player's LOCAL wall clock — the two are compared directly, so a UTC stamp here would be off by the player's offset and look right in one timezone). `ResolvedLevelFor` is the one answer, read by `MainWindow.ResolvedLevel` → `TrackedLevel`. `SourceLabel` is one table, the `CharacterClasses` rule. **Per-class levels UN-PARKED by DRA-356 (DRA-352 D4, Founder-directed)** — the park's premise stands (no log line or dump carries them); the source is the player's statement plus the equipped-set join. `CharacterLedger.ClassLevels` holds the same pair per class: a ding is written RAISE-ONLY to every class `ClassSourceFor` names, a statement raises every equipped class below it and LOWERS only the minimum. The answer is the MINIMUM over equipped classes (`CharacterLevel.ResolveEquipped`, fed the roster ONLY in `MainWindow.ResolvedLevel`); an equipped class with no memory falls back to the single pair and is NAMED, never guessed. Words: `UI.Shared/LevelReadout.cs` (the class half is `CharacterLevel.BasisLabel`) |
| Tail the file | `Core/LogWatcher.cs` — 150 ms polls, offset-based |
| Settings + profile paths | `Core/AppSettings.cs`, `Core/AppPaths.cs` (`EQBUDDY_APPDATA`) |
| The opt-in heartbeat (the ONE off-machine send) | Requirement `docs/v2/telemetry.md`. Policy `UI.Shared/TelemetryHeartbeat.cs` (the only writer of the three keys), words `UI.Shared/TelemetryCopy.cs` (verbatim §8.3), the only sender + endpoint `Core/TelemetrySender.cs` (the one host literal, set by DRA-369), one clock per process `EQBuddy/TelemetryRuntime.cs`. An isolated profile never prompts or sends |
| Automated launch vs live profile | `UI.Shared/IsolatedLaunchPolicy.cs` + `scripts/isolated-profile.ps1` — pin the child last, refuse both live lines. Audit: `docs/ops/live-state-isolation-audit.md` |
| Zone map geometry, aliases | `Core/ZoneMap.cs` — `ZoneMapFiles.IdentityKey` is the ONE answer to "are these two spellings the same zone" (lowercase, drop a parenthetical, drop a leading "the", squeeze spaces/'/-) |
| What level a zone's creatures are | `Core/ZoneLevels.cs` + `Core/Data/ZoneLevelBands.json` ← `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/zonelevels-transform.py` (DRA-84 D1). The wiki's `Level of Monsters` row, from the COMMITTED zone cache — **fetches nothing**, plain JSON so trap 74's container problem cannot arise, `--check` in `check.ps1` + CI. **FOUR admitted shapes and no fifth: `N-M`, `N`, `N-M+`, `N+`** — 87 of 118 pages (46 closed + 41 open-topped), everything else ABSENT. **An open top is `Max` = null, never an invented maximum** (D2, Helm option (a) of three; D1 shipped strict and measured the cost at 54% of drop weight, now 12%): the number before the `+` is NOT promoted, `Band.Max` is `int?` so every reading site is asked, and a gate's TOP arm stands down where there is none. Scope is narrow — a verbatim whose SOLE defect is the `+`; multi-range (`1-15, 35`, `1-13+, 35-50`), prose (`20-40+ (50+ inside pit)`) and `Quest Only`/`n/a`/`?` stay refused, and coalesce-as-open-top is refused by name. ABSENT SHIPS TOO (`NoBand`), so `Lookup`'s four outcomes tell "never read a page" from "the page is silent" from "the page says something we will not read". Lookup is exact title then `IdentityKey` and **nothing looser** — containment would hand "Commonlands" West Commonlands's band and match a zone name inside free prose, and a wrong band is a number a surface states as fact (`ZoneLevelsTests`' committed negatives are real `DropZones` values that containment DID match). The distinct-count telltale is measured on the CLOSED bands and on the verbatims, because discarding a maximum coarsens the parsed pair by construction (53/87 vs 36/46 and 64/87). One reader: the Farm Gear band gate (row below) |
| **WHEN** a zone's content exists | `Core/ZoneEras.cs` + `Core/Data/ZoneEras.json` ← `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/zone-eras-transform.py` (DRA-180 D1, plan P1). The `{{<Era> Era}}` banner every zone page opens with, from the COMMITTED zone cache — **fetches nothing**, plain JSON so trap 74 cannot arise, `--check` **and `--selftest`** in `check.ps1` + CI. **A level band can never answer this**: Kael Drakkel's row is `30-60+`, so `Min` 30 PASSES the band gate for a level-29 — correctly, it really does hold level-30 giants, in an era the world has not reached. That is the Founder's Baron's-Blade FAIL. 104 of 118 pages carry a banner, all six words spelled exactly as `QuestEraLadder.Eras` (`IndexOf` is the ONE producer of a ladder position, trap 4). **TWO refusals, both REPORTED by name and never guessed**: an era word off the ladder (`quests-harvest.py` has a rename map because QUEST pages drift; the zone corpus does not, measured, so none is mirrored) and two DIFFERENT eras on one page (the same era twice is one claim stated twice, admitted). Matching is case-insensitive and ships the LADDER's spelling, so a lowercase wiki edit cannot move the bytes a gate reads; the match is **not positional** (trap 66) and 2 of the 104 banners sit on line 2. **ABSENT SHIPS TOO (`NoEra`) and "absent means Classic" is refused BY NAME** — 3 of the 14 (Stonebrunt, The Warrens, Kerra Island) are the Paineel-adjacent set in a corpus with exactly one `{{Paineel Era}}`, so a default would put a level-45 camp in a pre-Paineel world (trap 73). Lookup is exact title then `IdentityKey` and **nothing looser**, the `ZoneLevels` rule verbatim — a wrong era is worse than a wrong band, because this is the claim that REFUSES a row. **The corpus's ONE fold collision is decided out loud in `ZoneEras.Reconcile`, not in the transform (trap 4): two Chardok pages (Kunark / Chardok Revamp) fold to one key while `DropZones` says `Chardok` (155 mentions), and the key answers the EARLIER era** — content existing from Kunark on exists later too, and the later reading would refuse a zone that is in the game. Its other arm: a disagreement where either side is ABSENT answers NOTHING. **There is deliberately NO distinctness floor** — an era is a CATEGORY, so 57 pages saying Classic is 57 pages agreeing; the guard is the mapping of each era spelling to a NAMED zone plus the exact 14-name ABSENT list (`ZoneErasTests`, 9 prove-failed mutants). Join measured before the gate exists: **81% of the catalog's drop weight lands on a zone with an era**. **No reader yet** — the era gate and the curated WorldEra (which starts ABSENT) are D2/P2's |
| What eqlwiki says a faction TURN-IN is worth | `Core/FactionRoutes.cs` + `Core/Data/FactionRoutes.json` ← `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/faction-routes-transform.py` (DRA-746, DRA-728 D1). Item × count-per-turn-in → faction × integer delta, from the COMMITTED `All Positive Faction Quests` table and quest-page facblocks joined to `QuestCatalog` turn-in items — **fetches nothing**, plain JSON, `--check` + `--selftest` in `check.ps1` + CI. Negative deltas KEPT; requirement/obtain cells carried verbatim (shown, never checked — no tier table exists). **Refused by name and reported** (`faction-routes-report.md`): `(+?)`, direction-only blocks (an editor's "(+5)" beside "got better" is NOT the game's line), unjoinable quests (none / several catalog items), several different blocks on a page, and table-vs-page disagreement (Gnoll Bounty 3× vs 1×) — never averaged. A refused RAISE ships in `Unrouted` with its why, so `StatusFor` is Routed / DirectionOnly / None. Faction match is `FactionNames.Same`, not a copy. Guards: `FactionRoutesTests` — race-unlock must-list both ways against the achievements fixtures (26/40 routed), the half-floor STOP rule, committed negatives. **One reader: `UnlockGuidance.Faction`'s cold-start arm** (DRA-747, D2) — fires only with NO raiser in the pool (a raiser leaves the row unchanged + one "wiki also lists" line); lines are `GuidanceLine`s carrying their own `Evidence` (route Catalog, "your inventory dump shows" Personal), turn-ins to go said PER FACTION, held items from `HelperInputs.Bags` and an absent dump is `NoInventoryDump`, never "0 held". `HelperInputs.Routes` null = arm off; the Unlocks tab passes none yet. Guards: `FactionRouteColdStartTests` (Lion Delight is the committed negative) + the phone row in `HelperSurfaceParityTests` |
| Spawn points / timers | `Core/SpawnPointLedger.cs`, `Core/SpawnTimers.cs` |
| Wiki lookups + contribution packs | `Core/EqlWikiMobs.cs`, `Core/WikiContribution.cs` |
| The widget itself | `EQBuddy/MainWindow.xaml.cs` (~4.5k lines — the hotspot) |
| A guide's stages, objectives, and how complete OUR data is | `Core/GuideCatalog.cs` + `Core/Data/GuideCatalog.json` — CURATED, never auto-written; the harvested half is the row below and `LoadEmbedded` merges the two. `Validate()` is lock 4a executable: an `Authored` objective answers **who + where + what** and cites a source, a `Stub` says what is missing, a **`Transcribed`** one carries the page's ONE sentence verbatim in `What` and is REFUSED if it fills who/where/when/how or carries a title (promotion to `Authored` is a human PR, never a transformer), a `RewardKey` is one the Sky checklist already owns. **The six questions are the SCHEMA, not a fill-in bar** — `When`/`Why`/`How` are optional and stay EMPTY where no source answers them (`GuideCatalog.FabricatedProse` refuses the sentences we invented once; trap 73). `GuideAttachment` is the seam the HELPER now answers (DRA-83) — a REFERENCE (`{ Kind, Key }`), never a recommendation. Two curated rules and no third: `GearUpgrade` on a Sky turn-in keyed on the reward ITEM (93 of 95 — the two misses are our own naming bugs, named in a test), `XpFarm` on the ONE open-farm step of each keyed on the zone; `GearFarm` ships EMPTY on purpose because no curated step farms gear. `scripts/dra83-attachments.py` is the record of the two rules. The answer is `Recommendations.Attached` (row below), the guards are `TheShippedAttachmentsAreTheTwoSkyRulesDra83Placed` + `EveryShippedAttachmentNamesSomethingItsOwnCatalogKnows` — the flip `NoShippedGuideCarriesAnAttachmentYet` promised |
| Turning a guide into the rows every surface draws | `UI.Shared/GuideChecklistProjection.cs` — **three matching rules, one per tab**: `Apply` for Sky (the REWARD KEY), `ApplyEpic` for Epic (the CLASS — an epic class has one quest, so its section groups collapse into one), and `ApplyQuest` for the General tab (the QUEST NAME, gated on `GuideType.NormalQuest` so a Sky guide never answers there). Sky and Epic REPLACE a group's rows; an unguided one comes back the same object (lock 5). **`ApplyQuest` does not replace anything** — it returns a group to draw ALONGSIDE the catalog pane, or null. `UI.Shared/GuidePresentation.cs` owns every word, and **each of the six is drawn in exactly one place**: WHAT is the row title, `who · where` the row's line, when+why+how the hover (the phone has no hover, so they ride the row — trap 35). An unanswered question draws nothing |
| The AUTO-WRITTEN guides beside the curated ones | `Core/Data/HarvestedGuides.json.gz` ← `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/guides-transform.py`, run after `quests-promote.py` in the weekly refresh. 1,158 guides, one per catalog quest with anything to say, **byte-reproducible from the cache** (CI runs `--check`; so does `check.ps1`). **Every guide's `retrievedAt` is the refresh date, and `refresh.py` PASSES it as `--stamp`** — it stamps `refresh-state.json` last (so a throwing promotion cannot advance the window past pages nobody processed), so letting the transform read that state would bake the PREVIOUS run's date and redden the gate on the stamp alone, data identical. A quiet week keeps `ranAt` for the same reason: nothing regenerated. Guards: `TheCommittedGuidesCarryTheDateTheCommittedRefreshStateClaims` + the `--stamp` wiring row (DRA-84 D3). It fetches NOTHING. Four objective shapes and no fifth: a `Transcribed` line of the page's prose, a `Collect` stub per catalog item, the hand-in, the opening `TalkToNpc`. **`GuideCatalog.Merge` admits one only where no curated guide claims the `QuestName` and the app actually loads the quest** — curated always wins. `guides-report.md` is the weekly diff's readable half |
| Where a guide step's tick lives | `UI.Shared/GuideProgressRouter.cs` — SIX homes, one writer each: `SkyTurnIn` (a `RewardKey`), **`SkyItem`** (an acquire-shaped step naming exactly one of ITS reward's checklist rows → that row's own box, so the loot auto-tick lights it), **`EpicItem`** (an objective whose ID names an `EpicQuestChecklistItem` → that row's box; `EpicCompleteToggle` stays the per-class done store), **`LedgerItem`** (a harvested `Collect` naming one of ITS quest's turn-in items → the character's owned count, done at `Have ≥ Need`, and **a manual tick is refused** — the bags are the answer; the row carries `QuestChecklistRow.LedgerItemName` so a surface draws it AS the item row it already had rather than a checkbox beside one — DRA-46), **`QuestCompletion`** (the hand-in → `SetCompleted`, the catch-up line the General tab writes, consuming nothing), else the guide ledger. Group-scoped: one class's Wind Rune — or epic row — is never another's. `GuideStores` carries what the decision reads; `Drawn()` is the one producer of "which objectives this tab shows" (the Epic classic-era lens) |
| Quest surface (all four tabs) | `EQBuddy/QuestsView.xaml.cs`. `QuestsWindow` is a thin host; `QuestsRoom` is the shell's **Guide** room (label only — the wire key is still `quests`). **Both build their own instance** |
| What the widget's right-click menu shows minimized | `UI.Shared/WidgetMenuPolicy.cs` — the ≤4 lock. `Tag="expanded"` in `MainWindow.xaml` hides the rest; `WidgetMenuTests` reads the XAML against the list |
| The Evolved shell | `EQBuddy/ShellWindow.xaml.cs` + one `*Room.cs` per room; `UI.Shared/ShellPages.cs`, `ShellLayout.cs`. Player door: widget context-menu `Guide…` through `ShellHost.OpenGuideDoor` (opens the Guide room, and recovers a shell the ✕ took); `EQBUDDY_SHELL` is the review hook |
| "What should I do next?" | `Core/Recommendations.cs` — the ONE cross-domain ranker (PRD §12 HOME-001..006, DRA-70). Nine Founder goals, `ShapeFor` is the must-list; **the join key is the ZONE**, so a place serving two selected goals outranks either alone. Top 3, and the cap says so. Every why-line is a typed `WhyFact` record tagged `Personal` or `Catalog` — **the WORDS are `UI.Shared/HelperPresentation.cs`**, which is where HOME-006's ban (nothing may call a camp safe, easy or survivable) can be swept. A faction sentence is `UnlockGuidance.Faction`'s own, passed through, never re-phrased. Drawn by `EQBuddy/HelperRoom.cs`; picks persist per character (`AppSettings.HelperGoals`/`HelperFactions` through `HelperGoalStore`). **The goals are ONE dropdown, not nine chips** (DRA-71 D2, Founder smoke 1) — `EqMultiPicker`, with the faction sub-picker a second face that appears only once its goal is picked. **Every ENGINE has decided about the character's level** (DRA-71 D3, smoke 2): `LevelUseFor` is the must-list — `Consumes` or `Exempt` with a reason, null only for a goal that has no engine — and `HelperMustListTests` proves each row by running that engine at two levels, so a `Consumes` that is really a comment fails. Today only `LevelUp` consumes: the discount is about a zone's THROUGHPUT, and for faction/unlocks the zone is a POINTER to where a criterion IS. Unknown level ranks on personal evidence unchanged and the room says so + offers the Character door — never a guess. **Throughput is OUTCOME evidence, never an adjective** (DRA-71 D4, smoke 3): there is no mob-HP or con-colour model, so "vs difficulty" is your output/fight-length/deaths/downtime against YOUR OWN pooled figures (`ZoneHistory.Baseline`, two zones minimum or it compares a zone with itself). Four named discounts, each with a sentence on the same row and no bonus arm — the XP rate stays the primary term. The weight reads damage AND healing (`OutputPerSecond`), or it marks down every zone a healer did their job in. The instance tier is REPORTED and weighs nothing until P10's mote slice. `WhyCap` is 6 since D4 and the tier is emitted LAST, so the cap takes the fact that weighs nothing rather than a caveat. **Farm Gear is the fifth engine** (DRA-71 D6, smoke 4a/4b) and it asks the INTENT first — `Core/GearUpgrades.cs`, three `GearIntent`s with their own `ShapeFor` must-list, single-select through `GearIntentStore` (`HelperGearIntent`/`HelperWornPicks`/`HelperGearQuests`). `UpgradeWorn` anchors on the worn items the pick names (absent = all, filter semantics), `ReplaceSlot` on every worn slot and reads no pick, `FarmToSell` is Deferred to D7. Drop rows group by ZONE and quest rows by QUEST (`RecommendationKind.Quest`, only behind the include-quests toggle); the weight is how many of your open upgrades a row feeds. **Level CONSUMES since DRA-84 D2** (it was Exempt from D6): `Recommendations.GearBandGate` REFUSES an `UpgradeWorn`/`ReplaceSlot` ZONE row whose eqlwiki band (row above) sits outside the character — top `OutgrownBy` (10, reused) or more under, or bottom `GearBandReachAbove` (5, NEW) or more over. **It refuses rather than demotes, deliberately unlike `OutgrownWeight`** — that halves the player's own measured camp, these are Catalog rows and their presence is what the Founder failed — and it fires even over a personal seen-drop. Open top ⇒ TOP arm stands down, BOTTOM arm still applies. Quest rows are not camps and are NOT gated; `FarmToSell` stays level-Exempt (no camp to band). Unknown level / no bands / no band for the zone ⇒ stands down whole (trap 73). Refusals are REPORTED (`RecommendationSet.GearBandRefusals` → `HelperPresentation.GearBandRefused`, trap 50: count + each band + the level + which rule, no adjective), and refusing every zone is its own `GoalGapReason.EveryZoneOutsideYourBand` because `NoCatalogUpgrade` would be a lie. **MEASURED: Crushbone `5-20` refuses from 30, NOT at the Founder's 29** (29−20 = 9) — the plan's worked example is one level off its own constant; the constant was reused as instructed and the gap is pinned in `TheFoundersCrushboneExhibitIsRefusedFromThirtyAndNotAtTwentyNine`. The ITEM side is still ungated (D6's survey: 11,196 records, exactly one wearable Level key) — the gate reads the ZONE. **A drop row NAMES ITS CREATURES, or it is not a row** (DRA-84 D4, P3 — the Rathe class of failure, which a level rule could never refuse: its band is 13–45). `GearUpgradeFact.Who` is a LIST — `GearMobsPerItem` (3) in the PAGE's order, never ranked, the rest counted as the page's ("and 4 more on its page"); it was `FirstOrDefault`, and 3,830 of 10,637 pairs name more than one. `Recommendations.WhoRule` then WITHHOLDS an offer nothing can answer for — its own count and its own sentence beside `GearWithheld` (that is a CAP, this is a RULE), its own `GoalGapReason.NoUpgradeNamesACreature`. **It runs AFTER the band gate and the order is the decision**: both remove rows, D2's refusal quotes a band and a level where this one can only say a page was silent. The player's own kills answer too (trap 4 — the catalog clause is empty by construction there); quest rows are exempt (the quest IS the path). The plan's stop-and-escalate seam is COMMITTED with its floor armed — `ItemCatalogWhoCoverageTests`, 98.2% of wearable pairs against a 50% floor. **It also removes a camp that is not a place**: 75 of the 107 anonymous pairs carry a `DropZones` string like `}}` or `:* Dread` (one bulleted wiki line read as five zones), and a non-place has no creature under it either — the promoter defect is a `FABLE.md` stub, not fixed here. **`FarmToSell` is answered since DRA-71 D7 and NOT by that sweep** — it has no worn anchor, so `GearUpgrades.Sweep` refuses it outright and `Recommendations.FarmToSell` answers from your own LOOT priced at your own sale. **EIGHT of the nine goals now answer** (`+ FarmMotes`, `+ MakeMoney`, and `+ FarmMaterials` since DRA-149 D3); only `Achievements` is Deferred. `LevelUseFor` gained `Consumes` for motes (the Founder asked for "highest-level zone") and for materials (a camp is a camp), and one `Exempt` (money — coin is a property of the creature, so both readings of a level rule are wrong). **Farm Materials is `Recommendations.FarmMaterials` over `Core/TradeskillMaterials.cs`** (DRA-149 D3, P4): the catalog's `Recipes` column, whose profession HEADINGS name the ingredient — an item page lists what it is USED IN, so the record IS the material and products self-filter (150 of the 165 intermediates drop nowhere; the 15 that do are pelts and ores you really kill for). It reuses `BandGate`/`WhoRule`/`WhoFor` as SHARED generics with Farm Gear, same constants and same order, with their COUNTS apart (`MaterialBandRefusals`/`MaterialWhoWithheld`) because one merged number explains neither list. **A non-place is refused BY NAME** (`TradeskillMaterials.IsPlace`) — unlike the gear side, all 12 `Various Zones` pairs here DO name creatures, so the who rule would have kept them. Fletching draws `NoMaterialDrops` with its own zero (33 materials, none dropping). The block above the rows is unchanged — professions picker, standings, the Watch skill-up preset (a door WITH a side effect, idempotent through `TrackedRule.Matches`) and the wiki door (DRA-71 D8). **`Join` INTERLEAVES the merged parts round-robin** since D7: three engines on one zone put ten sentences against a `WhyCap` of six, and concatenating them let the cap trim a whole engine off a row whose headline still named its goal. **The PHONE ranks with the same `Rank` over the same `HelperInputs` since DRA-71 D9** — the inputs are assembled ONCE in `UI.Shared/HelperSources.cs` (`Read`/`Gather`/`Signature`; the room and `EQBuddy/PhoneHelperSource.cs` are its two callers, each holding its own memo per trap 45), the projection is `Companion/CompanionProjection.Helper.cs` and decides no word, and the screen is **READ-ONLY**: every control in that room writes to the profile the PC is playing from, so the pickers port as INTENT — the face's own words plus where it is changed — and a door is its label + the desktop's TIP riding the row, never a link (trap 35). Guard: `HelperSurfaceParityTests`. **A GUIDE STEP asks the same producer since DRA-83**: `Recommendations.Attached` (its own file) resolves a `GuideAttachment` by calling the SAME `LevelUp`/`FarmGear` methods `Rank` calls — `GoalFor` is the kind→goal must-list, a zone kind matches `Recommendation.Zone` and `GearUpgrade` matches the LINE naming the item, the engines' own caps mean **the guide never says more than the room would**, and their GAPS are dropped (the room keeps those sentences, once). Words: `HelperPresentation.Attached` (`AttachedWhyCap` 2, and it says what it held back). Lookup + memo: `UI.Shared/GuideAttachmentLines` / `GuideAttachmentMemo`, one instance per HOST (`EQBuddy/GuideHelperSource` for the desktop, `PhoneHelperSource` for the phone, both over `EQBuddy/HelperPass`) rebuilt only when `HelperSources.Signature` moves. It rides `QuestChecklistRow.HelperAnswer` → both surfaces |
| Which professions exist, and where this character stands in them | `Core/Tradeskills.cs` — CURATED, never auto-written: the EIGHT with a Mastery AA, each row naming its ability so `TradeskillsTests` can read the spelling back out of the shipped `AaCatalog` ("failing *Jewelcrafting* recipes") instead of trusting a comment. `Crafting Mastery` is refused by name; Tinkering/Spell Research/Make Poison/Fishing are OUT with the reason (no Mastery AA) as committed negatives. `Match` is WHOLE-STRING over per-profession aliases — the wiki spells Jewelcrafting three ways and "Jewelry Making" is carried from classic EQ, marked as not-the-wiki. **Standings persist since DRA-71 D8**: `QuestLedgerStore.CharacterLedger.Skills` keeps the highest value per profession with the LOG's stamp, written by `MainWindow` from `StatsSnapshot.SkillUps` and read by the Helper's block — only the eight are admitted (`TrackFilter`'s rule, a second kind of row), and highest-wins is what makes the launch replay a no-op. Picks: `TradeskillPickStore` over `AppSettings.HelperProfessions`, absent = all eight. **The item→profession join is the `Recipes` column, NOT `Categories`** (DRA-149 D3). The park was real and measured the wrong field: 14 of 11,231 pages name a profession in `[[Category:…]]` (re-taken by the DRA-84 D3 and 2026-09-28 refreshes, still exactly 14), while **1,296 carry a recipe list** with all eight professions in it as headings. `TradeskillMaterials` reads it through `Match` — the same whole-string matcher that admits a skill-up line, so the reader cannot drift from the ledger's rule. The player-facing sentence is `ProfessionsFarmNote` and it is pinned to `items-catalog-report.md`'s recipes row, never to its own literal; `itemcatalog-build` re-takes both surveys on every refresh (`--check` writes nothing). **Where you can BUY a profession's supplies is the row below** |
| Where the wiki says the VENDORS are | `Core/ZoneMerchants.cs` ← `scripts/harvests/eqlwiki/merchants-transform.py` (DRA-149 D4, plan P5 — the Founder's FAIL item 3, second half). The 118 COMMITTED zone wikitexts' MAP KEY, **fetches nothing**, plain JSON so trap 74 cannot arise, `--check` in `check.ps1` + CI. Item pages mention a vendor on 3 of 11,196; the zone pages name one in 50 of 118, **359 lines, 353 of them distinct** (the trap-73 telltale — this is transcription, not boilerplate). **ADMIT is structural: a LIST ITEM containing "merchant", in the three spellings the key has** (`*`, `#`, raw `<li>` — the last often with the previous item's `</li>` in front, and missing that arm silently dropped Oggok's whole fifteen-entry key). Prose is REFUSED and the report lists all 42 of them by zone, including Kaladim's real *"merchant who sells Ore … at approximately 750, 200"* — "a sentence mentioning a merchant" has no edge; "an item of the map key" is a rule the page defines. Lines are TRANSCRIBED (`[[links]]` folded, `'''` off, map numbering dropped) and **the vendor's NAME is deliberately not a field**: the same list carries `[[Cleric]] Guild` and `[[Kafia Ratsbone]]`, so lifting link targets would print "Cleric" as a merchant. The name stays in the sentence. The item→profession join is a **CURATED eight-row keyword table** (`ZoneMerchants.Keywords`) read out of the shipped lines, matched at a WORD START — plain substring filed *"Cooking and L**ore** Books"* under Blacksmithing — with plurals free (`gem` → "Gemstones"). **Crafting STATIONS are out by name** (oven/kiln/forge/loom/barrel, a third of the lines) and so is `alcohol` (the product, 40 lines). `EveryCuratedKeywordMatchesSomethingInTheShippedCatalog` deleted three rows a human wrote from instinct — `spices`, `metal bit`, `pelt`, all real supplies, none on any line (trap 78: a dead keyword has no symptom). P5's park floor was "under 3 zones for Jewelcrafting"; it matches **17**, so the face shipped. Words: `HelperPresentation.MerchantsNote`/`MerchantRow`/`MerchantsShown` (cap 3, ONE line per ZONE — Freeport's key would fill every list alone)/`MerchantsCapped`/`NoMerchantsFor` (subject is eqlwiki's maps, never the game). Door is `HelperDoorKind.WikiZone` → `WikiLinks.Page` (a zone title is not an item), **wired in `HelperRoom.Door`'s fourth wiki arm** — the third one shipped unwired for a whole slice. Drawn under each profession row by `HelperRoom.BuildMerchants`; phone parity is `CompanionHelperMerchants` + the page-side must-list |
| Where motes have actually dropped for you | `Core/MoteHistory.cs` — ONE new fold, `Pool` × `Motes.IsMote`/`PotencyOf`, with the hours and the conned band JOINED from `ZoneHistory` rather than recomputed (trap 4). **Two floors, and the second is the one `MinHours` cannot see**: `MinKills` = 50, because one Infinite mote in a legitimate twenty minutes is a rate that will never happen again. Void-Touched is COUNTED and weighs nothing — the ladder gives it no number, so the field is separate and the sentence names it rather than reading as a zero. **There is no catalog arm**: all eleven shipped mote records carry a `DropZones` and every value is "Various Zones"/"Unknown"/"D3+ Zones" (`MoteCatalogSurveyTests`, which fails the day a real zone arrives). Engine is `Recommendations.FarmMotes` — the Founder's three criteria as three named discounts, no bonus arm, and an untiered zone is never marked down for not being an instance |
| What a vendor has actually paid you | `Core/SaleHistory.cs` ← `SessionRepository.SoldRows` (a snapshot probe beside D4's `ThroughputRows`; no schema migration). **It is the evidence the money engines rank on, and the survey is why**: eqlwiki quotes its `merchant_value` at a Charisma and a faction standing that differ per page (235 of the 646 readable ones say so in their own heading), so the catalog's number is a quote somebody was given rather than a property of an item. `ItemCatalog.Record.MerchantCopper` + `MerchantCondition` land from the promoter and **weigh nothing** — they name an item you have never sold, `Evidence.Catalog`, printed with the page's own condition. **The DRA-84 D3 refresh filled both in**: 773 of 11,196 records carry a price (403 distinct, 205 with the page's own Charisma/faction condition, 568 with none); the 2026-09-28 refresh moved that to 821 of 11,230 (410 distinct, 197 conditioned — seven pages dropped their CHA heading on the wiki — 624 with none) and the catalog's number still weighs nothing. Coin grammar: `Core/CoinText.cs` (`Parse`, the inverse of `StatsSnapshot.FormatCoin`, round-tripped in `CoinTextTests`; anything it cannot read exactly is ABSENT, never guessed) |
| Per-zone all-time evidence | `Core/ZoneHistory.cs` — ONE fold, two sources, and the split is the design: time/XP/coin/deaths from `SessionRepository` rows (attributed to `PrimaryZone`, so a rate always travels with its session count), kills and fight length from `MobHistory.Pool` (keyed on the real kill zone). Under `MinHours` it reports NO rate. `ConnedMin`/`ConnedMax`/`ConnedKills` are the level band the evidence was earned at, from `/consider` only — an unconned creature contributes NOTHING rather than dragging the floor to 0 (DRA-71 D3); `Recommendations.OutgrownBy`/`OutgrownWeight` are named judgements, not a derived XP curve. **Third source since DRA-71 D4: per-session dps/hps + their combat seconds**, from `SessionRepository.ThroughputRows` (a snapshot-JSON probe in the `ProgressSeries`/`MobRows` idiom — the `Dps` COLUMN has no denominator and a rate cannot be pooled without one; NO schema migration, that is still its own filed slice), joined BY ROW ID and pooled by combat seconds rather than averaged. `Dps`/`Hps`/`OutputPerSecond`/`DowntimeShare`/`DeathsPerHour` answer null under the floor — unknown is never zero, and a session with no combat seconds contributes nothing. `ObservedTier` needs no plumbing: `PrimaryZone` is the zone name the game printed, so `InstanceTier.FromZoneName` reads the observation the log already made |
| Auto-ticking Epic/Sky from loot, achievements import | `EQBuddy/QuestChecklistView.cs` |
| Desktop World theme | `EQBuddy/WorldWindow.xaml.cs` |
| Mobile server + projection | `Companion/CompanionHost.cs`, `CompanionProjection*.cs`. A new screen is a `CompanionSurfaces` name + a nullable section + a `ForSubscription` arm + a `SectionFingerprints` arm + a `RENDER` entry — the envelope never changes shape, so `CurrentProtocol` does NOT move for one. **Every SENTENCE rides the wire, never `index.html`** (trap 32) — **and a sentence the page is SENT but never DRAWS passes every projection test there is**, so the same slice adds its row to the page-side must-list (`HelperSurfaceParityTests.ThePageSpellsNoneOfTheHelpersWords`); D2 and D4 each added a Helper caption without one and the phone drew four of five (DRA-84 D5, trap 34) |
| The mobile page | `Companion/Web/index.html` |
| Type roles, spacing, radii, control sizes | `UI.Shared/DesignTokens.cs` |
| Icon geometry | `UI.Shared/IconPaths.cs` — vectors, never glyphs |
| The selectable pill | `UI.Shared/ChipStyle.cs` + `EqChip`/`EqSegmentedStrip`. **Never hand-build another one** |
| The multi-select dropdown | `DesignSystem.EqMultiPicker` (face + themed popup of check rows) + `UI.Shared/PickerFace.cs` for what the face SAYS. Four callers: the quest class lens, the Unlocks tab's pick, the Helper's goals and its two sub-pickers. **Never hand-build another one** — the sibling of the chip rule, and the quest class lens was migrated onto it in the slice that added it so the sentence starts out true. The cap is a WIDTH as well as a count (#184); `ClassFilterLabel` is now just the class picker's noun. Guard: `MultiSelectPickerTests` — a forbid-scan over every shipped `.xaml` with a committed negative that proves it fires (trap 78), PAIRED with a curated must-list of the surfaces that HAVE a multi-select (trap 34) |
| What a Loot surface shows | `UI.Shared/LootPresentation.cs` |
| What a quest row's badge and state rule say | `UI.Shared/QuestPresentation.cs` |
| What this item is called, and what it is called on the wiki | `Core/EqlWikiItems.cs` `NormalizeTitle` — **the ONE seam**: folds the "+N" tier off, then asks `Core/ItemNameAliases.cs`. Every reader is already through it (`ItemCatalog.Find`, `CachedInfo`, `LookupAsync`, `ItemInfoWindow`'s heading, `UI.Shared/WikiLinks.Search`), so one alias row fixes the catalog lookup, the fetch and the player's wiki door at once. The table is **CURATED, hand-written, one row per MEASURED miss with its evidence** — seeded by the Founder's bow, which the game spells `Deterioriated` and eqlwiki `Deteriorated` (DRA-149 D2). **Never fuzzy**: whole-string, case-insensitive, no containment and no distance — a near-match describes an item the player is not wearing, and an unknown name comes back unchanged so it is REPORTED as unread (row below) rather than guessed at. `WikiLinks.Page` is the non-item sibling (factions, professions): a page title must not be put through the item rule |
| What the player is wearing that EQBuddy cannot read about | `Core/GearUpgrades.cs` `WornFrom` → `WornSheet` — anchors AND the rows that could not become one, from ONE method (trap 4). A row the catalog cannot describe is still DROPPED, but it is now NAMED: `Recommendations` carries it to `RecommendationSet.UnreadWorn`, words are `HelperPresentation.UnreadWorn` (3 named + the count, trap 50; subject is EQBuddy's catalog, never the game) with a wiki SEARCH door per named item, and both surfaces draw it. A dump whose EVERY row is unreadable is `GoalGapReason.NothingWornIsReadable` and **does not ask for the dump again** — the command has been run and re-running it produces the same rows |
| Is this item better than that one | `Core/ItemDominance.cs` — the ONE metric table (AC/HP/Mana/DMG/ratio/attributes), the class-lock filter and the `+N` tier refusal. Lifted out of `UI.Shared/GearLocker.cs` in DRA-71 D6 so the Helper's catalog sweep and the Gear Locker read the SAME ARITHMETIC (trap 4); the Locker's three members are calls into it **since DRA-222 D6 — this line and `ItemDominance`'s own summary had claimed it since D6 while a private copy of `MetricPairs` stayed in the Locker, agreeing exactly, which is what a second implementation does until one of them learns something** — and **its "never BiS" scope lock is unchanged — it still compares your bags.** **The TIER rule is the one thing they no longer share** (DRA-149 D1): the Locker asks `CanClaimUpgrade`, where both names come off one dump and can carry a "+N"; the sweep asks `Dominates`, because **0 of 11,196 catalog names carry one**, so the tier test read `0 >= N` and returned nothing for 19 of the Founder's 19 gear anchors — a rule answered before it read its inputs, not a strict one. The CLAIM narrows to match ("a better BASE item than yours"), with the "+N is worth an amount the wiki does not state" caveat said ONCE per block, never per row (trap 73); no "+N" arithmetic is invented. Guard: `GearUpgradesFixtureSweepTests` (the Founder's committed dump vs the shipped catalog, floor 15 of 19). The Helper may name CATALOG items as farmable upgrades (`Core/GearUpgrades.cs`), and the amendment is narrow: every candidate has a WORN anchor, an empty slot answers nothing, every line is `Evidence.Catalog`, and the empty state's subject is the CATALOG rather than the game. `ItemDominanceTests` runs both surfaces over one table and proves each metric one at a time. **`Compare` answers a `DominanceVerdict` rather than a bool since DRA-222 D6** (S7.3) so a REFUSAL can be told from a loss and counted: the table prices every number and no SLOT, and a two-handed weapon that wins on all of them costs the off-hand. Row below |
| How many hands a weapon takes | `Core/WeaponHands.cs` — the ONE reader of a stats block's `Skill:` line (DRA-222 D6, S7.3). Two-handedness is the wiki's own **`2H` PREFIX**, never a name list: 441 of the shipped catalog's 6,844 wearable records, 1,159 one-handed, 2 `Unadmitted` (`SHIELD`/`Shield`, both carrying no `Dmg` and no `Delay`) and that value **refuses nothing** — the rule fires on `Two` alone, so a spelling nobody has measured cannot take a row off the player's screen (trap 73). The five spell-school skills sit on records with no `Slot:` line, asserted so a promoter change reddens `WeaponHandsTests`. **Archery and Throwing are deliberately NOT modelled as two-handed** — the block says nothing about hands and they sit in RANGE, so they read `One`, the permissive answer for a rule that only ever removes. `ItemDominance.Compare` refuses a `Two` candidate over a not-`Two` worn item **only when the player's own dump shows SECONDARY occupied** — a FACT and not the convenient proxy "the worn item is one-handed", which is wrong for an empty off-hand (trap 64b) — read off the WHOLE worn sheet rather than the anchors, since a player who picked only their helm has not emptied their shield hand. Counted end to end: `GearSweep.OffHandRefusals` → `RecommendationSet.GearOffHandRefusals` → `HelperPresentation.OffHandRefused` → the room AND the phone (trap 50). **MEASURED on the Founder's committed dump: his PRIMARY anchor found 64 dominating candidates, 29 two-handed — and with `MaxPerAnchor` 8, seven of the eight rows he could SEE were greatswords**, for a character wielding a second morning star |
| Which stats this character's classes actually wear | `Core/ClassStatRelevance.cs` (DRA-222 D6, S7.2) — the share of a class's OWN class-restricted catalog items that carry each number, derived from the catalog INSTANCE through a weak table (`GearUpgrades.SlotIndex`'s arrangement, and its reason), relevant at `RelevanceFloor` **0.25** over `MinClassRecords` **100**. **It is the game's own item design COUNTED, never a claim about what a class needs**: Mana on 50% of WIZ / 49% ENC+MAG / 47% NEC items against 3–6% of WAR/ROG/BER; INT 51–52% of the four INT casters against 6–8% melee; WIS 42% DRU / 30% CLR / 29% SHM against 6% BER; DMG 48% RNG / 40% ROG against 6% CLR. `ratio` takes DMG's answer because it is computed rather than transcribed (trap 4). ONE threshold and **no lift arm** — a lift over the wearable baseline makes AC irrelevant to a WARRIOR (66% vs 67%). **THE LIMITATION IS A COMMITTED NEGATIVE, NOT A TUNED FLOOR**: Mana is 19% for CLR and 23% for SHM and both answer NO, pinned in `ClassStatRelevanceTests` so a refresh that moves either says so. The cost is bounded because **it removes NOTHING** — it picks which improvement `ItemDominance.Gain` NAMES and puts `GearUpgrade.RelevantMetrics` above `ImprovedMetrics` in the sweep's order (and in `Recommendations.GearRow`'s, which had its own copy of the old key). Unknown classes ⇒ the EMPTY set ⇒ the pre-D6 ranking exactly (trap 73). **No sentence draws it**: "this moved two stats your class uses" would be a claim off a measurement of what item blocks happen to carry, so the visible half is the better-chosen `GainMetric` alone |
| Which upgrade the player has decided to GO AND GET | `Core/TrackedUpgrades.cs` — `TrackedUpgrade` (item · slot · the worn item it beat · the local stamp) + `TrackedUpgradeStore` over `AppSettings.TrackedUpgrades`, per character (DRA-216 D4, S12). **Its OWN object because a goal outlives the sweep**: `GearUpgrade` is rebuilt from the current dump and catalog every pass, so a decision hung on one would vanish when a new dump, a worn pick, a refused zone or a refresh removes the offer. **BASE ITEMS ONLY** — the identity is `EqlWikiItemService.NormalizeTitle`'s, the one seam, so a "+5" and its base name are ONE goal; **S8/S9 are PARKED** (a Helm park; lifting it is Dranak's) and nothing here holds, compares or invents a `+N` or an exaltation. **NO COMPLETION CONDITION, deliberately** (S12.3 is parked with them): untracking is the only way out and the block says so. The way IN is a `GearUpgradeFact` the engine produced — a bare name would be an anchorless BiS claim `GearUpgrades`' lock forbids — and re-tracking keeps the FIRST stamp. No gain and no drop zone is stored (the catalog and `ItemDominance` stay the one producer of each); the map/spawn join over this object is the row below. Carried on `HelperInputs.Tracked` from the one assembly point, RANKED ON BY NOTHING. Words: `HelperPresentation.TrackedHeading`/`TrackedNote`/`TrackedRow`/`TrackLabel`/`TrackTip`/`TrackedOnPc`; the phone is READ-ONLY (trap 35) |
| WHERE the thing you are going after drops, and which dot it is | `Core/GearTargets.cs` (DRA-216 D5, S13/S14, plan §3 Q8) — the join from the row above to a zone, a creature and your own archived spawn points. **A READER, never a store**: `TrackedUpgrade` holds no drop zone on purpose, so `ItemCatalog` is asked every pass (trap 4). **NO SECOND MAP ENGINE** (S13.1, S20) — `SpawnPointLedger` already archives the points, `ZoneMap.FromLoc` already places them and the map already draws a circle with a countdown; the only new question is *is this dot one of MINE?*, and the file computes no coordinate and loads no file. Three rules, all about what NOT to match: the ZONE is exact title then `ZoneMapFiles.IdentityKey` **and nothing looser** (the `ZoneLevels`/`ZoneEras` rule verbatim — `Bronze Long Sword` names `Commonlands` and a player in `West Commonlands` must get nothing); a non-place is refused through `TradeskillMaterials.IsPlace` (40 of the 6,004 wearable pairs, 15 spellings); the CREATURE is `SpawnCatalog.NameMatches` and **deliberately not `NameMatchesFuzzy`** — fuzzy rescues a TIMER from a wiki typo where a miss costs a countdown, here a false hit is a ring on a dot that does not drop it and a player travels to it. S13.5 falls out because `Points` is a list and `AtPoint` is asked once per point. **Two refusals, both REPORTED by name** (`Unreadable` = no page shipped, `NoDropZone` = the page names nowhere — 3,104 of 6,844 wearable records, the ordinary state of a quest/vendor/craft item), subject always EQBuddy's catalog and never the game. MEASURED before it drew: 5,871 of 5,964 place-pairs name a creature, and 2,213 name one `SpawnCatalog` knows as a zone named — that is the S14 split, so about a third of targets get a learned timer and the rest the ordinary point's projection. Words are `UI.Shared/GearTargetPresentation.cs` (caps say what they held back; `PointsNote` is the sentence that stops it reading as a spawn database). Hosts: `EQBuddy/MapView.cs` (a DASHED second ring outside the circle — never a recolour, the accent already answers "named") over `IZoneHost.GearTargets` ← `EQBuddy/GearTargetMemo.cs`, one per host (trap 45); the phone is `CompanionMapTargets` + `CompanionMapCircle.Target`, READ-ONLY (trap 35), with the target flag IN the map fingerprint (trap 72: tracking moves no coordinate). **The whole layer has ONE switch and it is applied in ONE place** (review D5-1): `AppSettings.ShowGearTargetsOnMap`, default ON, read in `GearTargetMemo.For` — already the single producer the map and the phone both read, so gating the views apart would be two callers answering one question, last one winning (trap 33). Off answers `GearTargetSet.None` and every reader already draws nothing on it. Writer is an `EqChip` in the MAP's toolbar (`MapFolder`'s precedent — a display preference belongs on the surface a mid-hunt player is looking at), **always visible**: a chip that hid itself on an empty answer would hide itself the moment it was used. Hiding is never untracking, and the tip says so. Dump keys are `mapTargetToggle` (the chip's PAINTED state) and `mapTargetRefused` — the refusal sentences went uncounted, so a refusals-only panel dumped the nothing-tracked line exactly (D5-2) |
| What quest steps can be done in the zone you are in | `UI.Shared/WhileHere.cs` (DRA-42 D1, requirements §18) — the ONE producer; the Guide room's `EQBuddy/WhileHereView` (above the tabs) and the phone's quests section both draw its answer, and `MainWindow.WhileHereNow` is the one builder of its inputs (trap 33). **The zone is `StatsSnapshot.CurrentZone` — the latest "You have entered" line — never a session's `PrimaryZone`.** Recomputes nothing: `GuideProgressRouter.Drawn`/`IsDone`/`IsSkipped`, and a step with unmet `PrerequisiteObjectiveIds` is not actionable. Three groups: tracked = Required, started-untracked = Relevant rewards (no class lens), the rest = Optional by NAME (General tab's class lens + era). Place rules are Core's `WhileHerePlaces`: exact then `IdentityKey` and **nothing looser** (not `QuestEntry.TouchesZone`, whose containment puts a West Commonlands drop in Commonlands), `TradeskillMaterials.IsPlace`, and three sources only — item drop zones, the quest's `StartZone` for a person step, the Sky quest's start zone for a Sky-home step. **Prose and a guide's `ZoneNames` are never read**, so Epic 1.0 steps are counted as unplaced, not guessed. Words: `WhileHerePresentation` (`Groups` is the one arrangement both surfaces walk). **D2's "before you leave" is the SAME producer asked about the zone LEFT** — `WhileHere.DepartureFor` over the snapshot's `Zones` (the entry before the latest), today's stores, own work only (Required+Relevant); said AFTER the move because the log is where a move is learned, never a pre-transition prompt. `ByQuest` is the one re-grouping the standing line and the notice share; the dismissal lives in `MainWindow.WhileHereLeftNow`, the one builder. **D3's map marks read the SAME answer** — `UI.Shared/GuideTargets` (host `IZoneHost.GuideTargets` = `WhileHereNow` behind `GuideTargets.Gate`/`ShowGuideTargetsOnMap`), own work only, strict `NameMatches`, and only a DROPPER (`WhileHerePlace.WhoDrops`) can be the creature at a dot. The mark is a DIAMOND, never the gear layer's dashed ring; words `GuideTargetPresentation` |
| What a player can DO about an unlock requirement | `Core/UnlockGuidance.cs` — one already-worded sentence per fact, three shapes and no fourth: own-kill faction movers + a kills-to-go estimate, the Sky checklist's piece count, a catalog-matched Task door. `ShapeFor` decides for every `UnlockNeed` and answers **null** for undecided (trap 34's must-list). **It never moves a tick** — an unlock is the game's answer, and "pieces in your bags" is not "obtained" (trap 4). A faction nobody has farmed draws nothing (trap 73). `UnlockLayout.Groups` emits one row per actionable criterion IN ORDER, which is how a surface pairs a row with its criterion. **The row is drawn in the six-question SHAPE since DRA-71 D5**: `RowDetail` is `who · where` (the top RAISER and its zone — a cost-only row points nowhere), `RowLines` is the two QUANTITIES that stay on screen (piece count, kills-to-go), `Hover` is the per-creature prose; `Lines` is still the whole set and their union is asserted to be it. **Which unlocks a character is chasing is `Core/UnlockPicks.cs` (`UnlockPickStore` over `AppSettings.UnlockPicks`) — ONE store, read by the Helper AND the Quests Unlocks tab.** Absent = ALL (filter semantics, the opposite of `HelperFactions` beside it), one flat list of subject names, and `Narrow` applies it PER SECTION so a race pick never empties the class half. Words for both pickers: `UI.Shared/UnlockPickReadout.cs`. `Recommendations.Rank` does the narrowing, not the room, so the phone inherits it. **"Is this requirement done" is `UnlockProgress.IsDone(c, factions)` and nothing else** (DRA-728 D3): the tab tick, the header count, both pickers and the Helper score all read it — the faction dump answers a faction it names, else the achievements flag (void under a granted unlock). **`UnlockGuidanceRow.ReadyNow` is set only by a DUMP** — every Sky piece in the inventory dump and not turned in, or the SHOWN cold-start route covered once — never by a checklist tick; it is `Rank()`'s second key (Goals.Count → ReadyNow → HasPersonalEvidence → Weight → Subject). Guard: `ReadyNowTests` |
| What the Buffs card's roster shows | `UI.Shared/BuffRosterPresentation.cs` — drawn by `EQBuddy/BuffsCardView.cs`. The HUD's expiring-buff chicklet is a DIFFERENT surface |
| Anything shared by both UIs | `UI.Shared/` — must stay framework-free (a test enforces it) |

## Traps that have already caused real bugs

Read this list before touching the areas it names. Every entry cost a
release. **Novels and evidence:**
[docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md)
(`### Trap N` anchors). Full pre-split file:
[claude-2026-09-08.md](docs/ops/claude-archive/claude-2026-09-08.md).

A compact row is the surviving rule + the guard (if any). Open the novel
when the one-liner is not enough to act. Tombstones keep the RULE even
after the named guard left with its surface.

1. **Screen pixels vs pre-scale units (WPF).** Conversions belong in
   `UI.Shared/WidgetMetrics.cs`, never inline. [#144](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-1)
2. **`ActualHeight` is 0 in a `Closed` handler.** TOMBSTONE (SA-2): the
   chip-stack guard is gone; the rule still binds anything that saves a
   size or position at teardown — capture it while the window is alive, or
   ask whether it needs persisting at all. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-2)
3. **`redirects=1` means the page you get is not the page you asked for.**
   Record the *served* title (`WikiPageText.Title`). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-3)
4. **One entry, two sources for one fact.** One producer. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-4)
5. **CSS: `margin: 0 auto` on a flex item kills cross-axis stretch.**
   Needs `width: 100%`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-5)
6. **CSS class rules beat presentation attributes.** `text.poi { font-size }`
   defeated SVG counter-scaling. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-6)
7. **Headless `--window-size` is not the CSS viewport.** Measure
   `innerWidth` before believing a capture. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-7)
8. **Fingerprints must exclude values that drift every tick.** [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-8)
9. **A layout class that also carries behaviour will hand that behaviour
   to the next user of it.** Split the class (`wide` vs `fills`). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-9)
10. **A fallback that skips the knobs the main path honours is a second
    product.** Guard: `UI.Shared/AlertSoundPlan.cs`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-10)
11. **A table of evidence that only one side can produce is a verdict, not
    a vote.** Every outcome needs a way to be named; yesterday can be
    outweighed. `Core/ClassInference.cs`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-11)
12. **A timer that changes measured `SizeToContent` width is not allowed.**
    Guard: `UI.Shared/PerfReadout.cs`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-12)
13. **A settings save writes the WHOLE file from the startup snapshot.**
    Guard: `UI.Shared/SingleInstance.cs` + clobber log on `AppSettings.Save`.
    A lock-skipping path (`--textprobe`) must write nothing — and check
    what its "read" persists. A per-toolkit lock does not guard the
    profile. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-13)
14. **`TextWrapping` does nothing inside a horizontal `StackPanel`.** Use
    a two-column `Grid` (`Auto,*`). Screenshot review is an acceptance
    criterion. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-14)
15. **Visibility and spacing belong to the thing that decides them.** A
    lifted host gets no `Visibility` and no `Margin` of its own. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-15)
16. **A vector only hit-tests where it is PAINTED.** A clickable inline
    icon is `DesignSystem.InlineIconButton`; `DesignTokens.IconInlineHit`
    (16) / drawn `IconInline` (12). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-16)
17. **`IsEnabled = false` is invisible when the style has no disabled
    visual.** Set Opacity (or dim the ink) and say why in the tooltip.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-17)
18. **An incremental WPF build can leave a STALE assembly with a FRESH
    timestamp.** Before trusting a screenshot that disproves your change,
    prove the binary has the string (UTF-16-LE grep). Zero →
    `rm -rf src/EQBuddy/obj src/EQBuddy/bin` and rebuild. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-18)
19. **A resource lookup inside a property setter runs before the control
    is in a tree.** Use `SetResourceReference` or `DesignTokens`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-19)
20. **A setting that only READERS touch is a lost capability.** Guard:
    `DeadSettingTests`. When you fold a surface, check what still writes
    each setting it owned. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-20)
21. **A shot name IS a filename, and `shoot.ps1` overwrites without
    asking.** Check `docs/screenshots/` and grep the docs first. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-21)
22. **A surface with no fixture state cannot be reviewed.** Stage the
    state in `scripts/shoot.ps1` as part of the change. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-22)
23. **Wrong-shape staging photographs a real state of something else.** A
    shot whose numbers you did not predict has not been reviewed. Seed
    through the same key and parser the app uses. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-23)
24. **A window TITLE is not an identity.** `shot.ps1` takes `-OwnerPid`.
    `-OwnerPid` cannot separate two windows of the same process — the
    shell's title carries its room (`EQBuddy — Progress`). Before adding
    a shot, check its title cannot match a sibling. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-24)
25. **A horizontal `StackPanel` clips a chip strip.** Non-fixed-width
    strips go in a `WrapPanel`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-25)
26. **Folding cards is where the last WRITER of a setting goes missing.**
    List every control and say where it went. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-26)
27. **Git Bash rewrites a leading-slash ARGUMENT into a path.** Invoke
    `/flag` Windows tools from `pwsh`, not Bash (`scripts/signing.ps1`).
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-27)
28. **A signing tool's exit code is not evidence the signature will
    validate.** `Invoke-EqSign` asserts `Valid` *and* a
    `TimeStamperCertificate`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-28)
29. **When a feature gate is deleted, the controls it used to un-hide
    stay hidden.** Grep the removed flag in HISTORY (`git log -S`). An
    absent control photographs as an unremarkable panel. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-29)
30. **A staging list that enumerates an enum BY HAND stops covering it
    the day the enum grows.** When you add a member, grep `scripts/` for
    its siblings. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-30)
31. **A capture surface must pin its own theme.** No Avalonia guard
    remains — KEEP the rule. `shoot.ps1` takes `-Theme`; anything new that
    shoots applies its palette first. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-31)
32. **The Mobile page NEVER re-fetches itself.** Guard:
    `CompanionPageUpdateTests`. Diagnose from the footer's version on
    THEIR device, not the PC's. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-32)
33. **Two callers with DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS produce two current answers;
    whichever ran last wins.** One builder:
    `CompanionSnapshotArgumentTests`. Ship the instrument before the
    third theory. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-33)
34. **A guard that forbids the WRONG thing cannot see a MISSING thing.**
    Pair every "no X may do Y" with a curated must-list. Guard:
    `GameCommandsTests.SurfacesNeedingACommand`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-34)
35. **An affordance the phone cannot honour is a lie with the right
    shape.** Port the INTENT; re-pick the control (selectable text + "on
    your PC"). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-35)
36. **A lifted view's own `ScrollViewer` swallows the wheel.** Scrolling
    belongs to the HOST. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-36)
37. **A lifted view's PINNED chrome stops being pinned.** List what each
    Grid ROW was buying; keep "read on arrival" above the scroll.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-37)
38. **A sticky payload's memo must record what the last message CARRIED,
    not what was ever sent.** When a render has a side effect, the
    repaint gate must see what the side effect needs. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-38)
39. **Identity is a property you PUT on the object** (`DesignSystem.Icon`
    stamps `Tag`). Every equality assertion deserves one negative.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-39)
40. **A bundled font is a FAMILY, not a file.** Guard:
    `BundledFontFaceTests` (parses `.ttf` tables). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-40)
41. **Wine truncates fractional glyph advances under `Ideal`.** Guard:
    `UI.Shared/TextRenderingPolicy`. A screenshot of text is quantitative
    evidence — measure before theorising. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-41)
42. **"Present in the build" and "in effect at runtime" are different
    claims.** Override on `FrameworkElement` and/or SET the value;
    diagnostics report the EFFECT. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-42)
43. **A property WRITTEN but never read means the app did something and
    told nobody.** Guard: `ImportReportReachesASurfaceTests`. When a doc
    comment says "for X to report", grep for X. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-43)
44. **Notifications go where the eye lands** — above the rows, under the
    header. A single passing screenshot is not proof a surface fits.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-44)
45. **A method that returns a long-lived UI object is a transfer of
    ownership wearing a getter's clothes.** Each host builds its own
    instance. Guard: `SurfaceOwnershipTests`. Do not re-justify the two
    exemptions as "one lane, so ownership does not matter." [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-45)
46. **When a surface moves, check what the OLD host called every tick.**
    The visible surface paints every tick; only chrome is throttled.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-46)
47. **Never let two code paths decide a destructive question.** Guard:
    `UI.Shared/LogJanitorPolicy`. When you find an "every N minutes" job,
    check its epoch — `MinValue` is a first-tick job. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-47)
48. **Enumeration is not permission.** Destruction is gated by
    `Core/GameWrittenLog` (character set, not segment count). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-48)
49. **Enumerate the participants and put them in the test names.** A
    suite is only as complete as the model it encodes (follower /
    toolkit / player, not selfSet vs not). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-49)
50. **A "top N by count" list hides the rare rows a player cares about.**
    A surviving cap must SAY so. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-50)
51. **When staging is cumulative and the fixture is shared, reset is the
    contract.** `shoot.ps1` restores the pristine fixture before every
    shot. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-51)
52. **Before asking anyone to weaken a guard, re-derive the premise from
    a second source.** An exemption list with nothing legitimate in it is
    a hole. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-52)
53. **When you delete, rename or fold a WINDOW, grep `scripts/` for its
    title.** Run the shot **batch**, not one `-Shot`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-53)
54. **Read git's bytes, not PowerShell's decode of them.** Wrap
    `[Console]::OutputEncoding = UTF-8` around `git show` / `git log` /
    `gh api` comparisons (`scripts/whatsnew-guard.ps1`). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-54)
55. **Unfolding a card does not undo its fold.** A fold may only name
    keys that are NO LONGER CARDS. Guard: `SectionFoldIdempotenceTests`
    runs the whole `AppSettings.ApplyMigrations` chain twice. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-55)
56. **When a dump carries two numbers about one thing, make them come
    from the same moment.** `WidgetDump.PaintOneMoment`;
    `surfacesBehind` is the assertion, not something to wait for. A
    polling wait needs a liveness question (`tick`) as well as a value
    one. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-56)
57. **A test project sharing ONE stateful thing needs
    `[assembly: CollectionBehavior(DisableTestParallelization = true)]`
    in the same commit.** TOMBSTONE: the Avalonia suite is gone; the
    shape is not. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-57)
58. **The `EQBUDDY_EXPAND` dump is one flat namespace.** Re-key a second
    host with `UI.Shared/ShellDumpFacts.Prefixed` — do not hand-write a
    second producer. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-58)
59. **A hotkey is not a door** — nothing is bound by default. When you
    subtract a surface, enumerate entrances a player who has never
    configured anything actually has. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-59)
60. **A channel file is shared state another agent is writing while you
    write it.** (a) Re-read the ref at splice time. (b) APPEND in
    explicit UTF-8 — never whole-file rewrite. A channel diff is
    additions-only. (c) **Additions-only passes on a SILENTLY TRUNCATED
    append** — Bash eats backticks inside `python -c "…"`, so a markdown
    note loses every backticked identifier and still diffs clean. Write
    the note with the editing tools; if the tail is mojibake and will not
    anchor, concatenate two FILES. Read an identifier back.
    (d) **The hole is closed for the DESTRUCTIVE half** (2026-09-10):
    `scripts/channel-wipe-guard.ps1` + its `-selftest`, in `check.ps1` and
    CI, refuse a PR that empties, deletes, truncates below its tier's
    floor, wholesale-replaces, or newly MOJIBAKES a channel file. Tiers:
    `*-FEEDBACK.md`/`DECISIONS.md` are append-only ledgers (90%),
    `HANDOFF.md` (and the `HELM.md` pointer) is state that lifts holds (65%), the inboxes are drained by
    design and get the wipe + mojibake checks only. No `-Force`: an
    archive move and an encoding repair stand the checks down by BEING
    one. **Replace has two arms, and the second is the one that survives
    an argument about encoding:** 3a compares lines, 3b compares ENTRY
    HEADINGS through a key with non-ASCII stripped and case folded (85%,
    both checked tiers), so re-encoding, re-indenting and reordering
    cannot move it and **the repair exemption deliberately does not reach
    it** — a rewrite that un-mangles a file *and* drops forty entries used
    to be waved through by 3a. Entries are matched mid-line too, because
    `c7a597a8` collapsed `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` into 2 lines and a line-start
    reading would give 3b eight headings to measure 1,051 entries with.
    **It catches CATASTROPHIC loss, and nothing else — (a) and (c)
    still have no guard.** A stale-base clobber of 36 lines out of 10,600
    is 99.7% retention and passes; so does a silently truncated append,
    which is additions-only and retains everything. `git diff
    <the-ref-you-based-on>..HEAD -- HELM-FEEDBACK.md` is still yours to
    run. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-60)
61. **The SCREEN is a mutex both harnesses must acquire.**
    `scripts/shoot.ps1` and `tests/EQBuddy.E2E` (`AppHarness.Launch`) take
    the same lock. Guard: `ScreenLockTests`. Wait for the window
    `shot.ps1` will actually look for. A batch names every failing row.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-61)
62. **`AppendLogLines` returns when the tail has read the bytes, not when
    the app has acted.** Every "and nothing happened" assertion needs the
    moment it is true AT — wait for a positive event that can only occur
    after the code under test has run. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-62)
63. **A "no limit" sentinel is a number some layer will do sums with.**
    WPF `ShowDuration` default `int.MaxValue` overflowed the shared
    dispatcher timer and stopped the clock. Guard: `UI.Shared/ToolTipPolicy`
    (30 s) + `ToolTipPolicyTests` / `ToolTipTimerTests`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-63)
64. **`tests/EQBuddy.E2E` does not reference the app it launches.** Run
    `dotnet build EQBuddy.slnx -c Release` before any E2E whose result
    depends on a `src/EQBuddy` edit — mutation runs included. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-64)
64b. **When you add a second producer of a value, grep every condition
    that reads it and ask what each one MEANT.** A proxy (`Candidates.Length
    == 1`) is a claim about the world. Name the fact (`DumpNarrowed`).
    Second producer = spellbook dump; the product lock is "the spellbook
    is never a timer source." [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-64)
65. **Every `File.WriteAllText` to a file the player cannot recreate is
    a torn-write waiting for a kill.** Guard: `Core/ProfileJson` (temp +
    `Flush(flushToDisk: true)` + `File.Replace`) and `ProfileJson.Read`
    (present-and-unreadable → `.bak`; a missing file is `Missing`).
    `ProfileJsonTornWriteTests`. A recovery handler that writes is not a
    recovery handler. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-65)
66. **A forgiveness rule written against one POSITION is a rule about
    the fact.** One word apart, at ANY position, unless one word
    truncates the other (`SpawnTimerTests`). When you suppress a wrong
    trigger, check the RIGHT one still works. Placeholders are whole mob
    names. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-66)
67. **A default that means "everything" is only safe if the client
    always narrows — including a first-run client.** Guard:
    `CompanionFirstPairingTests`. Measure a frame's byte count; a clean
    browser profile (no `localStorage`) is the only honest first pairing.

68. **A guard written as "fill the gap" steps aside for exactly the
    value it was built to override.** Redirect is unconditional; door is
    `EQBUDDY_ALLOW_LIVE_APPDATA=1`. Guard: `TestProfileIsolationTests`
    asserts the ENVIRONMENT. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-68)
69. **A host redirect does not cover a child `ProcessStartInfo`.** Pin
    `EQBUDDY_APPDATA` AFTER the caller dictionary; refuse both live
    lines. Guard: `UI.Shared/IsolatedLaunchPolicy` /
    `IsolatedLaunchPolicyTests`. **Corps doctrine** (ops
    `EXO-PLAYBOOK.md` entry 6). Audit:
    `docs/ops/live-state-isolation-audit.md`. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-69)
70. **Soft max ≤3 is a count, not a mutex.** Experiment A′ on EQBuddy
    (the lab), not a Corps standard. Claim before kick:
    `scripts/claim-seat.ps1` refuses a default claim on a work item **ANY
    live seat holds** — a `-Mode challenger` claim and a disjoint slice hold
    it too, and only an `abandoned` claim releases it (DRA-76). It used to
    refuse only against an EXCLUSIVE holder, so a default executor started
    beside a live `-Mode challenger` seat: two on one card, neither refused,
    which is what #566/#568 cost. `-Mode challenger|disjoint|replacement` is
    the explicit override and is never refused — **that `challenger` is a CLI
    token naming a seat-mutex claim category, NOT the Challenger role of
    "How a ruling lands" above**, which is a Paperclip agent and touches no
    seat script (DRA-305 §2; the collision is harmless but never invisible,
    so each sense is qualified where it appears);
    `scripts/release-seat.ps1 -ForceStale` recovers a dead holder and is
    now the only way past a holder that is gone — so the refusal names
    every holder AND which of them look stale.
    Store is gitignored `.claude/soft-seats/`. **The claim key is the
    Paperclip card, `DRA-<n>`, and only that** — one scope carries two
    names (GitHub `#445` IS `DRA-28`), and a mutex over free text refuses
    neither spelling. A bare issue number is REFUSED with the reason, never
    auto-mapped; `-PaperclipIssue` may only restate `-WorkItem`. Evidence
    before graduation. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-70)
71. **A fold that is right for IDENTITY is not automatically right for a
    QUANTITY the fold decides.** `BaseName` folds ranks — correct for "which
    buff is up", wrong for "how long", so rank V got rank I's wiki duration
    and every alert armed off `BuffState.ExpiresAt` fired ~8 min early.
    Ranked lengths are MEASURED, per exact ranked name
    (`Core/Data/RankedBuffDurations.json`) — never derived from a rank
    formula or a mote multiplier; every row re-derives its own observation
    (`RankedBuffDurationTests`). SCR is spent ONCE, on the ranked length,
    floored to a server tick (`BuffDurationModel`). **A surface that degrades
    gracefully must be asserted on what it SAYS** — an expired chip lingers at
    0:00, so presence passes on the broken code. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-71)

72. **A repaint gate keyed on everything EXCEPT the store the feature writes.**
    The Quests tab's signature carried the quest ledger, the turn-ins, the
    inventory stamp — and neither checklist LIST, which is what
    `SkyLootAutoCheck`/`EpicLootAutoCheck` actually write. So the box was
    ticked and the tab kept drawing the moment before, for the whole session.
    When you add a reader of a store, grep what makes its surface REDRAW and
    check that store is in it. A count is not enough (a swap leaves it
    unmoved) — fold the ids that are set. Guard:
    `QuestsView.ChecklistTickSignature` + the E2E loot row, which timed out
    before the fix and passes in 4 s after. Dump both numbers from one moment
    (`questsSkyAcquired` beside `questsGuideDone`) — "the store says so" and
    "the screen says so" are different claims (trap 56).
    **And a fold over TWO lists must carry WHICH LIST.** The same gate put
    `SkippedObjectiveIds` and `DoneObjectiveIds` through one `guideId + "/" + id`
    string, so an id in exactly one of them contributed the same hash and the same
    1 either way — while `QuestLedgerStore.SetObjectiveMembership` MOVES an id
    across in one locked write. Signature unmoved, early return, the other window
    still drawing the step crossed out. Harmless until DRA-218 gave the difference
    a reader (`QuestChecklistRow.BlockedBy`); the list is now in the hashed string.
    **The guard needs the writer to be one that cannot force a repaint** — every
    write site inside a view force-refreshes itself, so only the phone or the other
    instance reaches the gate (`ChecklistTickSignatureTests`, the lens probe's
    `guidedone` verb) — **and it needs the surface to have STOPPED redrawing on its
    own first** (`WaitUntilStill`): without that anchor the row is GREEN on the
    broken build, riding a repaint that was already coming.

73. **A schema that has a field for every question becomes a licence to
    ANSWER every question.** "All six must be addressed" was read as
    validation, so 48 authored steps got ten template sentences — nineteen
    asserting spawn cycles and group size against wiki pages that say
    neither — each cited to that page and then piped into the share-back
    draft as "EQBuddy shows:", asking players to correct our own guess.
    Optional fields, and a curated deny-list of the invented sentences
    (`GuideCatalog.FabricatedProse` + `NoShippedStepCarriesAnyOfTheInventedSentences`);
    a filled `When`/`How` must name what it rests on. **The tell is
    DISTINCT-COUNT: 48 rows carrying 10 distinct values for a per-row fact
    is a template, not research.** Survey a curated file before believing
    it — Fable's #480 last-look found this by counting, not by reading.

74. **A "byte-identical" gate over a file with a CONTAINER asserts which
    toolchain built the container.** gzip is not reproducible across zlib
    builds, so `guides-transform.py --check` went red on CI against a
    `HarvestedGuides.json.gz` whose CONTENTS were identical (runner 3.12 vs
    a 3.14 box — run 34615319696). Compare the thing the claim is ABOUT —
    decompress first — and gate the WRITE on the same comparison, or every
    refresh PR carries a binary diff that says nothing. Applies to any
    zip/archive/PNG/db claim. **The failure mode is the bad one:** a gate
    that reddens on a toolchain version teaches the next person to re-run
    until green, and then it is a guard nobody believes. Pinning the
    toolchain instead only moves the tripwire onto the next upgrade.
    **And a report ABOUT a generated file needs the same care as the file:**
    the report shipped `Authored: 5244 / Stub: 27` beside a catalog holding
    `1196 / 4075`, because its guard checked two TOTALS and the rule change
    had moved rows between buckets without moving either
    (`TheReportIsThereAndItsCountsMatchTheCommittedFile` now asserts every
    bucket). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-74)

75. **One transport code for three causes: a client that GUESSES which one has
    written silence for the other two.** WebSocket `onclose` is 1006 for a
    refused upgrade, a rate-limited one and a sleeping PC alike, so a QR-scanned
    pairing code the PC would not accept re-dialled forever behind an empty
    phone page — the guess covered only a REMEMBERED code. Ask the wire: the
    same-origin `GET /ws?token=…` separates 403 / 429 / 400 in one request, and
    a sentence naming a cause you did not measure is trap 35 with the right
    shape. **Two more shapes came out with it.** (a) The news must live in the
    ONE producer that repaints — `refreshStale()` runs every second and erased
    anything the close handler wrote. (b) **A silent retry against an endpoint
    with an abuse guard spends that budget on its owner**: five failures per
    minute, and the backoff reached it in fifteen seconds, so the phone locked
    itself out of the correct code it was about to be shown. A refusal STOPS.
    And a socket that opens can still paint nothing — picks that do not overlap
    the PC's offer left a header over a blank page. Guard:
    `CompanionPairingFailureTests` (page assertions with committed negatives;
    the three statuses and the lockout arithmetic against a real server).
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-75)

76. **A repair gated on "this is the first time" cannot reach a device the BROKEN
    build already wrote state onto.** DRA-60's fix enabled the offered surfaces when
    a phone's `FIRST_RUN` missed them — `if (firstPairing …)`, where
    `firstPairing = !choice`. The Founder's phone had already paired against the
    broken build, whose first snapshot persisted `{quests:false,gear:false}` to
    `localStorage` (the `if (offerChanged) saveChoice()` line fires on every first
    snapshot, because `offered` starts empty). So the one device that needed the
    rescue was the only device it could not fire for, and rescanning the same QR
    reloads the same key. **Before shipping a repair, ask what the broken build
    persisted, and whether the new condition is still true on a device that ran it.**
    `!choice` was a proxy for "nobody has chosen yet" (trap 64b); the FACT is "a human
    touched the picker", stamped by `commitChoice()` — the one human door — so a
    deliberate all-off choice survives and an accidental one is repaired once, out
    loud. **And the reason it read as a network fault is worth its own line:** the same
    URL pasted into the PC's browser WORKED, because `FIRST_RUN` is chosen off
    `innerWidth >= 900` and the wide list contains `quests`. Two surfaces of one build
    disagreeing across a CSS breakpoint looks exactly like wrong-Wi-Fi. Guard:
    `CompanionScreenChoiceRecoveryTests` (five of its six redden on the pre-fix page).
    **And the harness had the same blind spot:** every run started with empty
    `localStorage` and `-Snapshot` rewrote `FIRST_RUN` to the snapshot's own offer, so
    the green run that verified #550 could not have seen this. `-StoredChoice` seeds the
    reporter's state and suppresses that rewrite — **a fixture that removes the mechanism
    verifies its absence.** Second instrument:
    `node scripts/dra64-choice-probe.mjs [olderPage.html]`.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-76)

77. **The cheapest test of "can they reach me" is the one test that cannot fail for
    the reason you are investigating.** The companion server binds LAN addresses only,
    so diagnosing a phone that would not load began — every time — with pasting the URL
    into the PC's own browser. Windows routes a machine's traffic to its own address
    internally: it never crosses the wire and is never seen by the inbound firewall, so
    it passes while every phone on earth is being dropped. The PC then *agreed*, because
    `ClientCount` counted that browser and the window said "1 device connected". Three
    separate people read that as the server being fine. **Ask whether the measurement can
    distinguish the hypothesis from its negation before you spend it** — and when a
    surface counts participants, make ORIGIN part of the count, because a local caller is
    not evidence about a remote one. Guard: `CompanionReachability` (verdict + words) and
    `CompanionServer.IsSameMachine` / `OffBoxConnects`, counted at ACCEPT so a refused
    phone still proves the path is open; `CompanionReachabilityTests` asserts the local
    browser NEVER reads as Reached, with a real-socket half that prove-fails.
    **Sibling of trap 76** — same smoke, the other layer; 76 is the page that
    connects and draws nothing, this is the packets never arriving.
    **The sibling half is worse.** The advice under it named causes nobody had measured
    (trap 35's shape) and its one concrete instruction was wrong in the exact case it
    existed for: Windows' allow-list is keyed on the executable PATH and displayed by
    NAME, so "check Firewall → Allow an app" sends a player to a list where an
    `eqbuddy.exe` from an OLD install path is already ticked. DRA-64 was precisely that —
    v2 runs from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EQBuddy Evolved\publish\`, every rule on the machine
    named the v1 path, and the only inbound Allow that fit was scoped to the Tailscale
    address the QR ranks LAST. **When you tell a player to check a list, check what the
    list SHOWS them** — identity a UI hides is identity the player cannot verify.

78. **A detector's PATTERN LIST can be silently empty, and an empty list
    matches nothing and reports clean.** `channel-wipe-guard.ps1` built
    its mojibake markers as `@([char]0xE2 + [char]0x20AC, [char]0xC3 +
    [char]0xA2, …)`. **PowerShell binds `,` TIGHTER than `+`**, so that
    parses as `a + (b, c) + d` and collapses the whole list into ONE
    string of every marker joined by `$OFS`. It matched nothing. The
    guard reported a clean file for the commit that took HELM-FEEDBACK.md
    from 15,670 mojibake markers to 63,782. **Parenthesise every element
    of a computed array literal** — and, generally, **assert a detector's
    list is non-empty and that it FIRES, in the same commit that adds
    it**: trap 34 is a guard aimed at the wrong thing, this is a guard
    aimed at nothing, and only the second one is green.

79. **A WPF `Popup` is its own top-level HWND, so `PrintWindow` renders
    everything EXCEPT the dropdown the shot is about.** The staged
    `shell-helper-picker` came back BYTE-IDENTICAL to the closed shot — a
    correct, well-composed photograph of a button — and only `md5sum` on the
    two files said so. `shot.ps1 -WithPopups` composites the owner process's
    visible EMPTY-TITLED windows that intersect the region (the title clause
    is what stops it swallowing a sibling — trap 24 from the other side), and
    WARNS when it finds none. **A screen grab is not the fix**: it was tried
    and reverted twice in twenty minutes — the always-on-top widget, then an
    unrelated app — which is the failure `PrintWindow` exists to prevent. The
    screen lock reserves the screen against other HARNESSES, not against the
    machine. **And a translucent surface is only as honest as what you
    allocated under it:** the popup's 40%-alpha border composited onto a fresh
    (transparent-black) bitmap read as a Solarized contrast defect. That half is
    NOT fixed and ships as a stated caveat — `PrintWindow` overwrites the DC
    rather than blending, so pre-seeding the bitmap changes nothing. **Say which
    part of a capture is unfaithful; do not restyle the product until the camera
    agrees.** If a captured border is darker than its palette value, suspect the
    capture before the theme. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-79)

80. **`@(command)` NESTS an array instead of normalizing it, and `-eq` against
    an array is a FILTER — together they make a lookup that matches
    everything.** `Invoke-RestMethod` emits a JSON array as ONE object, so
    `@(...)` gives a 1-element array holding the 80-item one (`@(fn).Count` is
    1 where `(fn).Count` is 80 — measured). `$_.identifier` then
    member-enumerates and `eighty-identifiers -eq 'DRA-78'` returns the
    MATCHING ONES, not a boolean; non-empty is truthy, so `Where-Object` passed
    all eighty and merge-sync reported eighty concatenated statuses as one
    issue's status. **The negative case stayed correct the whole time** — a
    fake key gave an empty (falsy) array and refused properly, so "finds a real
    key, refuses a fake one" would have signed it off (trap 11, one layer
    down). Enumerate through the PIPELINE, which unrolls:
    `@($x | ForEach-Object { $_ })`. The paired "refuse a nested list" check
    was written, found unreachable after the flatten, and DELETED — a guard
    aimed at nothing (trap 78's other half). What replaced it is the reachable
    one: assert the field you are about to ACT on is a SCALAR
    (`Select-MergeSyncIssue`; reverting the flatten reddens it with the live
    symptom). [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-80)

81. **A dashboard may report an absence; it may never FREEZE one.** `exo-metrics.ps1`
    returned `$null` from `Invoke-Paperclip` for three different worlds — no
    credentials, the GET threw, and no matching record — and the callers gated on
    `$null -ne`. With `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` set to `localhost` against an API that
    binds a tailnet address, every read was refused, the Paperclip-derived rows
    computed as absent, and `-Baseline` **froze GWR 0.51 and printed its success
    line** — against the file's own header promising `unmeasured` with the reason,
    "never `0`". Measured: pre-fix + unreachable freezes `0.5051`; reachable is
    `0.4946`. The failure is now a VALUE (`Ok`/`NotConfigured`/`Unreachable`, with
    `NoRecord` the caller's to declare), and **the guard lives inside the writer**
    (`Write-BaselineFreeze`), so there is no path to the file that skips it — a
    `-Baseline` run with any unreachable input writes NOTHING and exits 3.
    `-NoPaperclip` is the one explicit door. **The asymmetry is the rule:** reading
    a stale number is recoverable, but a baseline is what every later claim is
    checked against, so freezing an unmeasured one poisons every comparison that
    cites it — and it does so silently, forever. Trap 11's shape (evidence only one
    side can produce) wearing trap 64b's clothes (a `$null` proxy for a fact nobody
    named). **And the printed recipe must regenerate the file it is printed in:**
    section 8 dropped `-WindowLabel`, so a labelled dashboard regenerated without
    its work-item names and the first diff to notice would have gone red for a
    reason that says nothing about metrics (trap 74). Guard: `-SelfTest` arms 9–12
    — a REAL socket to a dead port, the refusal predicate's four corners, and
    `Write-BaselineFreeze` asserted to leave no file behind. Prove-failed against
    four mutants. [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-81)

82. **A mutex is only as good as the store BOTH seats read — and a suite that
    hands the store in never tests that.** Every one of the 45 soft-seat
    selftest checks passed `-StoreDir <throwaway>`, so the refusal predicate was
    proven exhaustively against a directory the test itself chose, and
    DISCOVERY — the only thing that decides whether two seats meet at all — had
    zero coverage. **The store was fine.** `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` has
    sent every linked worktree to the main tree's `claims.json` since the
    original commit (b7f2eae4, 2026-09-08), a week before the duplicate that
    prompted the report; measured both directions for linked worktrees of one clone. Independent
    clones have their own stores — DRA-87 measured two (source checkout claimed
    `opus-dra87-docs-honesty` at 2026-09-15T06:18:05Z; Paperclip-instance clone
    claimed `dra87-docs-honesty` at 2026-09-15T06:20:34Z). DRA-87's two
    executors did not lose a race over one store — **both claimed, into stores
    that cannot see each other** (gap (a) / two-store miss). A mutex nobody is
    obliged to take still refuses nobody (gap (b) remains a general process
    risk; DRA-78 has no row in either store). **What made it look like a store bug is the
    shape to remember:** `claims.json` is gitignored while `README.md` and
    `claims.template.json` are committed, so a fresh worktree shows the
    directory WITHOUT the store, which is indistinguishable by eye from "every
    copy has its own". An invisible resolution is one everybody has to guess at,
    and the guess was filed as a root cause. So the resolution is now a VALUE
    (`explicit` / `git-common-dir` / `fallback`) that `claim-seat.ps1 -Where`
    prints, a grant from a `fallback` store WARNS on the same screen that
    granted it, and the `.gitignore` probe that used to gate the common-dir
    answer is gone — it was a proxy for "is this the repo root" (trap 64b) whose
    failure mode was to silently hand each worktree its own store. Guard:
    `soft-seat-selftest.ps1`'s DRA-90 block builds a REAL repo and a REAL linked
    worktree, calls the scripts with NO `-StoreDir`, and asserts the refusal in
    both directions plus one identical resolved path; its reachable negative
    claims the same card against a private `-StoreDir` and asserts it SUCCEEDS,
    so the rows above cannot go green by accident. Prove-failed: forcing the
    `fallback` reddens 7 of them. Two independent CLONES shared nothing until
    **DRA-102 made the refusal cross them: union-READ / local-WRITE over a
    machine-level registry of store PATHS** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DranakCorps\soft-seats\stores.json`,
    no claim data; `EQBUDDY_SOFT_SEAT_REGISTRY=off` or an absent registry
    degrades to the old behaviour and a grant decided that way says so) — the
    refusal names the holder AND its clone, `-Where` prints every store
    consulted, and the bar is two real `git clone`s in the selftest with the
    registry-absent negative beside them. **A seat that never claims is still
    refused by nobody in any clone**, so the remote (`gh pr list` /
    `git ls-remote` for a branch naming the card) stays the only check that
    crosses everything. **And the store being shared says nothing about the
    SCRIPT** (DRA-107, Helm-signed 2026-09-16): a linked worktree carries its own
    committed checkout of `claim-seat.ps1`, pinned at that worktree's commit, so
    the RELATIVE invocation runs a pre-DRA-102 copy that consults no registry and
    grants the cross-clone duplicate DRA-102 just closed — measured on one card in
    one second, local copy `OK: claimable`, resolved copy `REFUSED … [in another
    CLONE]`. 72 of 205 Bosun worktrees and 6 of 7 harness ones are that copy, one
    an agent workspace the dispatcher starts runs in. **Invoke both scripts
    through `"$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)/../scripts/…"`**
    (git ≥ 2.31) — right from a worktree and from the main checkout alike, so
    nothing branches on where you stand. The bare form is DEMOTED, not removed.
    Code on `main` cannot repair a copy that will never receive it, so this is a
    call-site rule, not a guard in the script.

83. **A linked worktree shares its clone's `[user]` block, so ONE wrong identity
    mis-attributes every worktree hanging off it — and GitHub attributes by EMAIL,
    so a commit reads as whoever owns the address no matter what the name says.**
    Three DRA-216 branches landed 7 commits / 4,589 lines of agent-written code
    authored AND committed as `David Edwards <david.edwards08@gmail.com>` — the one
    person here whose name carries release accountability. Caught only because a
    Planner review happened to read the authors, and **126 of the last 600 commits
    on `main` already carried that email** (121 as `David Edwards`, 5 as
    `DranakCorps-bot`): the three PRs were the instance somebody noticed, at a
    eighteenth of the real scale. Cause was environmental, not the repo —
    `~/.gitconfig` had NO `[user]` block, so every clone carries its own and they
    disagree; `C:\Users\david\source\EQBuddy` (a dispatch lane carrying **253**
    worktrees, on `claude/*`, `opus-dra*`, `fable*` and `sr-exec/*` alike) said
    `David Edwards`, and one `git config --local` fixed all 253 at once — which is
    also why the branch prefix reads as a lead and is not one: those are not
    different lanes, they are worktrees of the same clone.
    **`git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` is the one command that ends the guessing** — ask
    the CLONE, not the checkout you are standing in.
    **Second layer, so a clone inherits an identity instead of inventing one:**
    `~/.gitconfig` now carries one `includeIf "hasconfig:remote.*.url:…"` rule per
    agent repo → `~/.gitconfig-dranakcorps-bot`. **Keyed on the REMOTE, not a path**
    — runs create clones in unpredictable temp dirs, so a path rule covers today's
    workspaces and none of tomorrow's. Local config still wins (it supplies an
    identity, never overrides a chosen one), and David's own repos under the same
    account are deliberately not globbed in, one repo named at a time.
    **It is rewritable on an unmerged branch and impossible after the merge**, which
    is why the guard is pre-merge. Guard: `scripts/commit-identity-guard.ps1` +
    `-selftest`, in `check.ps1` and CI on `pull_request`. It reads EMAIL on BOTH
    identities (a rebase moves committer without author; checking one is a hole the
    size of the other) over **base..head MINUS `main`** — history is never judged,
    because `main` holds 126 commits it would refuse and a permanently red gate is a
    gate nobody believes (trap 74). **The Founder's door is the `founder-commit`
    LABEL, not a rule read off the commit**: an agent running in his clone produces a
    commit byte-identical in identity to one he types, so the separation has to come
    from outside the object; the label admits his identity for that PR only and still
    refuses everyone else. **Both fail-open paths SAY they judged nothing** — an
    empty range is exactly how a broken range computation reads as green. Prove-failed
    against six mutants, and the first draft's "main is never judged" row passed on
    the BASE term alone while the `--not main` term was deleted: the catching case is a
    branch cut from an OLD base that then merges a moved-on `main`.

84. **A return value the code writes about ITSELF is a label, not an observation of
    which call ran.** `WholeFilePublish.Outcome.Replaced`'s own docstring said it existed
    so "a test can assert WHICH path ran" — trap 78's rationale, written down and wrong.
    Reverting the live-name arm from the atomic rename back to `File.Move(overwrite: true)`
    — DRA-257's defect, exactly — left **all ten tests GREEN**, because the mutant returned
    `Replaced` too. The only guard that could still see it was a 2-core race test that is
    green on a 32-core box against the broken code (trap 77), so the revert would have
    merged clean on every hosted runner. Assert the FACT the call leaves behind
    (`AtomicRename.Renames`, incremented inside the rename that succeeded), never the value
    the mutation controls. **Trap 64b one level up:** there the proxy was a condition read
    off a value, here it is the value itself. A returned enum is only evidence about a
    branch that ANOTHER branch cannot also return.
    **Two more came out of the same card.** (a) **The primitive everyone names as the atomic
    one was the worst of four measured**: `File.Replace` / Win32 `ReplaceFile` went 12 red of
    12 at ~25% torn reads, adding DRA-225's share-mask failure back on top of the absent name
    it was supposed to remove — `File.Move(overwrite: true)` is 3 in 8, and only
    `FileRenameInfoEx` + `FILE_RENAME_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS` reaches zero. Documentation is a
    place to look; the mask is the measurement. (b) **A counter that says `torn reads: N` for
    five different defects tells the next seat nothing** — absent name, delete-pending,
    refused open, zero-byte and half-written have four different fixes, and DRA-257 hid inside
    DRA-225's admitted residual for two cards because one number covered them all (trap 75,
    and five rows of the flake ledger say "assert text NOT captured" because that text did not
    repay capturing). Count BY MODE, print every bucket including the zeroes, and fire each one
    on demand in the same commit.

85. **A high-water mark held in RAM, over a log that is RE-READ every launch, is not a
    high-water mark - it re-applies the same lines on every restart.** The Sky and Epic
    loot auto-ticks diffed session loot against a dictionary that launch, session start,
    character switch and review all cleared, while `LogWatcher` replays the whole file each
    time. So one looted Wind Rune parked one more `*` guess on the NEXT class's row per
    restart, until Hateborne (2026-09-18) had runes "held" across six classes with none in
    his bags. The quest ledger beside it had solved exactly this in August with a PERSISTED
    per-item time gate, and said so in its own class comment. -> **A consumer of replayed
    events keys on a persisted gate, never on "what I have seen since I started".** The
    auto-ticks now tick only loot `QuestLedgerStore.RecordLoot` accepts (`QuestLedgerFeed`,
    `ChecklistLedgerSync`); pinned by `SkyGuessReconcileTests.ARelaunchReplayingTheSameLootTicksNothingNew`.
    -> **And a story the codebase tells itself can be false.** "Hand-ins aren't in the log"
    stood in two surfaces and three doc comments; EQL writes "You offered ... / You complete
    the trade with ..." for every one (`HandInTracker`). Read the player's log before the comment.

86. **A blanket forbid-scan is green because it is pointed away from the file
    that carries the value.** A blanket forbid can only be written over files
    where the token is already absent, so it leaves out the file that carries
    the token — usually the file where the risk lives. One legitimate use is
    an allowlist: this line and no other, recognised by what the line is (it
    names the dump key), never by a line number. Sibling of trap 34 (forbids
    the wrong thing) and trap 78 (aimed at nothing): this scan is aimed at the
    only files it could be aimed at, and those are the safe ones. The tell: a
    forbid that passes on the day it is written with zero allowlist entries.
    Guard:
    `ClassStatRelevanceTests.TheOnlyDrawnSurfaceLineThatReachesTheRelevanceCountIsTheAllowedDumpLine`.
    [Novel](docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md#trap-86)

New trap discovered the hard way? Add the compact rule here and the novel
under `docs/ops/claude-archive/traps.md`. That is the whole point.

## Tooling notes that cost time when ignored

- **`pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/status.ps1`** — version, tag, dirty
  tree, hotspot, open PRs/issues, discussions whose last comment is not
  ours. Start here.
- **Write file content with the editing tools, not shell heredocs.**
  Backticks, `` ` `` inside Python triples, and box-drawing characters
  have all mangled a C# literal in one session.
- **`shoot.ps1` stands the real EQBuddy down first** (gracefully —
  session finalizes into `history.db`) and relaunches in `finally`.
  `-OwnerPid` keeps title matches on the process it launched. Do not
  scrub character names from committed shots (David, 2026-08-19); catch
  the wrong **state**.
- **PowerShell-tool failures are not always real.** Run scripts as
  `pwsh -NoProfile -File …` through Bash. A silent exit 1 is not proof
  nothing happened — check side effects (`git tag`, files, timestamps).
- **A PR that CONFLICTS with `main` gets NO CI run at all** — not a failing one, not
  a queued one (DRA-83, #622). `build-and-test` and `e2e-windows` build the
  MERGE COMMIT, so GitHub cannot create the run and `gh pr checks` says *"no
  checks reported"* while other branches pushed after yours get theirs. That
  reads exactly like a queue. **Check `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable` before
  believing you are waiting on runners**; merging `origin/main` in starts CI
  within a minute. Channel-file conflicts resolve as **their file PLUS your
  entry** — never a text merge — and you COUNT the entries afterwards
  (`grep -c '^## '`) and re-run `channel-wipe-guard` (trap 60).
- **The scripts assume pwsh 7.** Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs them
  differently (Hateborne, 2026-09-03): trap 54 false positives, and
  `$proc.Kill($true)` does not exist (now `Stop-Hard`). Prefer installing
  pwsh; treat a surprising 5.1 result as a host difference until git or
  the side effects confirm it.

## Screenshots of the desktop UI

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/shoot.ps1 -Shot quest-tracker
```

Acceptance criterion for every UI/UX gate. Seeds a throwaway profile,
`EQBUDDY_OPAQUE=1`, backdrop. `-List` names shots; `-Theme` takes any
palette (shoot `Solarized` at least once — it is the only light one).

**THE ILLUSTRATION LOCK (Helm-signed 2026-09-04): an illustration of our
own UI is a capture with a recipe, or it does not ship.** Adding a new
illustration means adding its shot to `scripts/shoot.ps1` in the same
change. If the surface cannot be staged, write the italic caveat — do not
invent a picture nobody can check. Check `docs/screenshots/` and grep the
docs for the name first (trap 21).
[Debt and why](docs/ops/claude-archive/operating-history.md#illustration-lock-debt-2026-09-04).

**A per-picture recipe does not record the SET's shared palette, and
`shoot.ps1`'s default is not every consumer's.** The landing is uniform
**`BlueGrey`** (Founder T4 look, 2026-09-10); the default `-Theme` is
`Turquoise`. So the obvious argument-free re-run of a landing shot commits
the WRONG picture and nothing complains — DRA-56 was itself dispatched to do
that, from a card written six hours before the Founder settled it. Guard:
`LandingSiteTests` pins all 11 landing assets (7 stills + 2 clips + the hero's launch
trailer and its poster, since 2026-09-28) to a
recipe manifest, compares page-against-manifest **both ways**, and asserts
the default is NOT the landing theme so every row's explicit `-Theme` stays
load-bearing. `record-tray-gifs.ps1` is the other way round — the landing is
its only consumer, so its default IS `BlueGrey` and bare runs reproduce the
clips. It also holds the page's two spoken promises (every picture
harness-made; no third-party requests) and that the page's own prose is
covered by the webfont's cmap.

**The screen is exclusive.** A batch takes a lock and refuses when another
holds it, or when any EQBuddy is running out of `bin\Release` /
`bin\Debug`. `-Force` overrides the refusal; nothing stands down another
harness's fixture app. `tests/EQBuddy.E2E` takes the SAME lock
(`AppHarness.Launch`; `EQBUDDY_SCREEN_FORCE=1`). Guard: `ScreenLockTests`.

`shoot.ps1` is Windows-only and, since E-2c, **the only capture surface**.
A capture needs `EQBUDDY_APPDATA` isolation MORE than an assertion does.

`EQBUDDY_EXPAND` takes `1`, card keys (`loot,motes`), and a theme's room
(`progress:raids`).

## Working on EQBuddy Mobile

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/mobile-harness.ps1 -Snapshot <snapshot.json> -Screenshot
```

Wraps the **shipped** `index.html` with a stubbed socket.
`ScreenshotFixtureTests` (opt-in via `EQBUDDY_SHOOT=1`) writes a real
snapshot through the real projection. This harness found trap 6; unit
tests could not have.

## Before you finish

- Verify to the class:
  [docs/ops/verification-ladder.md](docs/ops/verification-ladder.md).
  `scripts/check.ps1` is the fast local set. E2E is separate — it launches
  the real app and needs a Windows session:
  `dotnet test tests/EQBuddy.E2E/EQBuddy.E2E.csproj -c Release` after
  `dotnet build`. **CI runs it on every push and PR.** Nothing in that
  suite may assert the SCREEN. Dump the arithmetic's inputs and assert
  the relationship. Named flakes go in
  [docs/ops/flake-ledger.md](docs/ops/flake-ledger.md) — a rerun green
  does not close the row.
- Player-visible change? `WhatsNew.json` entry, reporter credited.
- Behaviour change? Update [docs/TestPlan.md](docs/TestPlan.md).
- New trap? Compact rule here, novel in the archive.

**To cover window behaviour**, add the fact to the `EQBUDDY_EXPAND` dump
in `MainWindow` and assert it from `tests/EQBuddy.E2E`.

**If the bug is a *sum* rather than a pixel, extract it into `UI.Shared`
and unit-test it there.** The WPF layer has no test project
([docs/TestPlan.md](docs/TestPlan.md) §5). Coverage is the surviving
argument; E-3's shell is a second consumer of everything in there.

**When MainWindow runs out of ratchet room, lift a surface out — don't
split the file.** The hotspot entry is a glob and `ArchitectureTests`
**sums** its matches. Deleting a surface beats extracting one. Pin the
behaviour in E2E *before* the move, then lower the baseline in the same
commit.
