# Decisions

**How to read this** — one dated `##` block per decision: what was chosen, what it could have gone to instead, and why. **This file is not in date order** — read the ISO date in each heading, never the position.

**Where the archive is** — older blocks are rotated **verbatim** into [`docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/DECISIONS.md`](docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/DECISIONS.md). Nothing is ever deleted; an archived block never revives a hold and never commissions work.

**What never rotates** — an open ask, an unexpired PARK or HOLD, and a standing rule stay in this file at any age, however old they are.

**Last cut** — 2026-09-21 by DRA-294, under the Helm arm (c) discharge floor ruled in DRA-282 Q2 item 4 (tip PR #773, `9121470c`): dropped the file from 55,411 B to the 32,768 B floor. Ten blocks moved verbatim to the archive — `DRA-199`, `DRA-180 D2`, `DRA-180 D3`, `DRA-164 D1–D3`, `DRA-149 D5`, `DRA-149 D4`, `DRA-149 D2`, `DRA-164 D4`, `DRA-181 D4`, `DRA-180 D1` — each re-checked by hand against line 7's floor and found to hold no open ask, unexpired PARK/HOLD or standing rule resident IN THIS FILE: DRA-164 D1–D3 item 8's republish question and DRA-164 D4 item 1's SIGN-as-PR-comment question are narrative, not markers, and both are overtaken by continued practice since (PR-comment SIGNs have landed routinely, e.g. DRA-262); DRA-180 D2/D3's "FABLE.md item not drained" notes describe `FABLE.md`'s own live state, not a hold here. The `exo-experiment:` STANDING block (re-pinned by DRA-231) and the DRA-161 Helm-LOCK entry are both unaffected and stay — DRA-161's LOCK is independently live and restated in `HELM.md` ("Soft/Planner may Soft file a fresh amended DRA-55 plan"), but nothing forced its removal to meet the floor so it was kept here too rather than risk-judged out. `DRA-262 D2` (2026-09-21) stays as the current tip. Full text of all ten: `docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/DECISIONS.md`.

## 2026-09-17 — Duo totals now reach EQBuddy Mobile, reversing the 2026-09-07 repair

- **EQBuddy Mobile shows combined duo totals again, not the watched character's own
  alone** · leave Mobile primary-only, as the 2026-09-07 Codex-review repair round
  deliberately set it (`CODEX-FIX-REPORT.md` §1: *"Mobile receives primary-only
  snapshots... It is an intentional behavior change, not merely a `[JsonIgnore]`
  correction"*) · **this is the user's own call, a direct reversal, not a bug fix and
  not the architect's or the executor's** — asked and answered explicitly: duo totals
  belong on the phone too, matching the desktop widget. `MainWindow.BuildSnapshot()`
  lost its `primaryOnly` parameter (dead once both Mobile call sites stopped passing
  `true` — this repo treats a dead parameter as a defect, `DeadSettingTests`'s shape)
  and both the 50 ms low-latency pump and the 1 Hz reconciliation tick now build the
  same `DuoSnapshot()` the desktop widget already used.
- **The pump's gate now reads `SessionStats.DuoVersion`, not `CurrentVersion`** · leave
  the gate on `CurrentVersion` since the snapshot argument was the only thing changing
  · corrected before it shipped: `CompanionPumpGate.ShouldPush` and the reconciliation
  tick's `Observe` must be fed the SAME version number as each other, or a teammate's
  own activity — invisible to `CurrentVersion` alone — moves the pushed snapshot's
  `Version` without ever satisfying the gate, and the low-latency pump leaks a push on
  every reconciliation tick, forever, the moment a teammate is assigned — the exact
  trap this branch's own history already found and fixed once for the desktop side.
  `MobileDuoPumpVersionTests.TheTrapIsReal…` reproduces the leak against the mismatch
  before proving `DuoVersion` on both sides closes it, and separately checks the
  gate/observed version agree across all four rollover shapes (no teammate, teammate
  active, a primary rollover, a teammate-only rollover).
- **The consequence, stated plainly rather than left to be discovered:** the archiver,
  the 5-minute checkpoint and the wiki pack still snapshot the watched character ALONE,
  by design (`DuoStatsTests.TheArchiverStillRecordsTheWatchedCharacterAlone`,
  untouched) — a teammate's session is still never persisted. So a phone glanced at
  mid-session can now show a bigger number than the session history that gets saved
  for that day ever will. `WhatsNew.json`'s unshipped 2.0.0 entry says this in as many
  words; `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/TestPlan.md` are corrected to match, and the
  stale "Mobile is primary-only" comment on `SessionStats.DuoVersion`
  (`DuoCompanion.cs`) is rewritten rather than left to describe a decision that no
  longer holds.

## 2026-09-07 (repair round B1–B4 — combat-span union, breakdown merge reversal)

- **`DamageBySource`, `PetAbilities`, `SpecialHits`, `DamageByAttacker`, `HealsByHealer`,
  `HealsBySpell`, `DamageTimeline` and `Effort` are now MERGED, reversing the hold recorded
  below** · leave them `mine`-only and label the header as a duo number instead · **this is
  the user's own call, not the architect's or the executor's** — the question was put to
  them explicitly (per-player breakdowns merged, or the header labelled as a duo number)
  and they chose merged: every board now sums to its own header. Ability/spell/hit-type
  rows (`DamageBySource`, `PetAbilities`, `HealsBySpell`, `SpecialHits`) have no field that
  says WHO performed them, so mine's own rows are left untouched and the teammate's are
  tagged with their character name rather than summed into a same-named row — "Kick" and
  "Kick (Buddy)" stay two rows, not one that has quietly forgotten two people kicked.
  Person-keyed rows (`DamageByAttacker`, `HealsByHealer`) have no such ambiguity — the name
  is already the external party who hit or healed you — and sum by name normally.
  `DamageTimeline` buckets on an absolute per-minute clock already shared by both logs, so
  merging is aligning matching minutes and summing, never concatenating. `Effort` sums
  `DamageDone`/`HealingDone`/`DamageDoneInResumeWindow` from both sides and keeps `Window`/
  `ResumeWindow` from mine, matching the same "windows are mine's own" rule `Recent` already
  uses.
- **`CombatSeconds` is now a real UNION of both sides' timestamped combat spans, not
  `Math.Max`** · leave `Math.Max`, reported as a budget-blocked gap (the earlier call, made
  without checking that the duo-combine partial file already reaches SessionStats' private
  `_combatSpans`/`_closedCombatSeconds` for free) · corrected once that access was pointed
  out: the union is computed against the LIVE `SessionStats` instances (not the snapshots
  `DuoStats.Combine` sees) inside the same partial class those private fields belong to, at
  zero cost to SessionStats.cs's own sync budget. The 2048-entry trim on very old spans
  (very long sessions) degrades to an over-count, never an under-count, of the trimmed
  portion — documented on `SessionStats.UnionCombatSeconds`'s own doc comment.
- **The duo-combine seam moved from `SessionStats.Duo.cs` to `DuoCompanion.cs`, no code
  change** · keep growing `SessionStats.Duo.cs`, which was raising `ArchitectureTests`'
  `SessionStats*.cs` hotspot ratchet baseline every round · renamed instead, since C# does
  not require a partial class's file to share its name — `DuoCompanion.cs` falls outside
  the glob entirely, so its growth (unconstrained by design) never touches a ratchet
  upstream also maintains, and the baseline moved back to its original 2375.

## 2026-09-07 (teammate-log redesign — isolated SessionStats, the ambiguous combine rows)

- **The teammate's log now drives its OWN `SessionStats` instance rather than a shared
  one gated by a `fromTeammate` flag** · keep gating individual `Apply` call sites, since
  three rounds of that approach each closed a named leak and each following audit found
  the same class of bug in a new place · replaced with structural isolation, because a
  flag can be forgotten at a new call site and an unattached instance cannot leak by
  construction — `TeammateLogTail.Stats` never gets a store, a subscriber, or the
  watched character's identity, so nothing exists for a future bug to attach to.
- **`CurrentDps` sums both sides' live rates** · pick one side's number, or show neither ·
  summed, and documented as an approximation: hiding either side's activity entirely
  is worse than a rate that is occasionally a rough estimate of the combined fight.
- **`Mobs` (per-creature farming rollup) ships as `mine`, unmerged, for v1** · merge it
  now, since kills/loot are exactly what a duo player wants combined · deferred (6a):
  correctly merging it needs a mob-identity join (kills, loot, coin/level bounds) while
  leaving `Xp`/`Factions`/`Considers`/`Zone` per-character — real work, scoped out of
  this pass. The gap (a mob a teammate solos alone never appears in "Mob farming") is
  documented in `DuoStats`'s own class doc rather than silently accepted.
- **`Encounters`/`RecentEncounters`/`EncounterCount`/`LastFight` stay `mine`, explicit
  non-goal** · a fight-identity join across two logs is a real feature, not a field-combine
  rule, and it is not being built as a side effect of this redesign.
- **`Deaths` and `CurrentTargets` stay `mine`** · "we died"/"we're fighting X" are duo
  facts a player might want · `TimedDetail(Time, Text)` cannot say WHOSE death it was
  without a shape change, and duo partners fighting the same things makes `CurrentTargets`
  redundant to combine anyway. Both stay a v1 gap, not a bug.
- **`PartyKillCount`/`PartyKillsByTarget`/`PartyKillsByKiller` stay `mine`, not summed** ·
  correctness requirement, not a style preference: your own log already counts a
  teammate's kill as a third-party line, so summing would double it.
- **Archives and `history.db` keep recording the watched character ALONE** · record the
  duo's combined totals, since that is what the widget shows during play · kept solo
  (reversible, privacy-safe): a teammate's session is not persisted or transmitted
  without their say, and a session record that always matches what the widget showed
  live is a promise this redesign does not make either way (the widget's live number
  already includes rates the archived snapshot never re-derives).
- **A teammate's data is never labelled as duo-provenance on the widget itself** (a kill
  count that silently doubles when a teammate is picked) · left as a documented gap,
  Part 7 item 1 of the approved plan — a small provenance marker is a real product/design
  question outside this pass's scope, not resolved here.

## 2026-09-20 — STANDING: the `exo-experiment:` tag index (re-pinned by DRA-231)

**This block never rotates.** Plan §10.1 makes the tag below the thing the M0-exit doctrine
capture cites, and `Get-Experiments` in `scripts/exo-metrics.ps1` regenerates the "Experiments in
flight" table in `docs/ops/exo-dashboard.md` by reading these lines — each tag *and the judging
clause running from it to the next blank line* — out of **this file**. DRA-231's cut moved the five
2026-09-14 entries that first carried them into the archive, so the tags are re-pinned here
**verbatim** under DRA-144's never-rotate floor: all six experiments they name are still in flight.
The full entries, with their calls and evidence, are in
`docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/DECISIONS.md` — follow a tag there for the reasoning, and
keep it here for as long as the experiment is open. Retire a tag by graduating the experiment, never
by rotating this block.

`exo-experiment: merge-sync` — judged by *merge-to-close latency*: the wall time
from a PR merging to its linked issue reaching a terminal state. The observed
failure is days (EXO-HARDEN-A2, EQ-V2-HOME-CATCHUP sat `in_review` long after the
work was on `main`), and the target is minutes, because the run starts on the
merge event. Stated net of the **wrong-close count** — issues this job moved to
`done` that a human then reopened. A sync that closes the wrong card is not
faster than the drift, it is just more confident, and the same "state net of the
harm" shape the seat-mutex tag uses for false blocks.

`exo-experiment: seat-mutex` — judged by *rework rate* and *PRs per delivered slice*
(baseline 3.7% and 2.15), because a duplicate executor spends both: #566/#568 cost one
full run and produced a second PR for one slice. Stated net of the **false-block count**
kept in `.claude/soft-seats/README.md`'s evidence list — a mutex that refuses work that
should have started is not cheaper than the collision, it is just quieter.

`exo-experiment: metrics-baseline` — judged by *whether a later window's claim can be
checked against it without re-deriving the window*: concretely, whether the §10.3
"current vs baseline" column fills from `docs/ops/exo-baseline.json` alone at the M2
checkpoint, without any §6 KPI being recomputed by hand. Stated net of the count of
metrics still reading `unmeasured`.

`exo-experiment: channel-rotation` — judged by *rework rate* (baseline 3.7%), counting
a channel-file clobber, a silently truncated append or a mojibake re-encode as rework,
because that is the class trap 60 records three times in six days and the only §6 term
this change can move. **Stated net of the effect that is NOT a §6 metric at all:** the
bytes an agent must read before it can append correctly. That is the reason the rotation
was worth doing and there is no KPI for it, so a later graduation entry cites the rework
rows and says the primary benefit went unmeasured rather than mapping it onto a number
it did not move.

exo-experiment: ssc-retirement — judged by *PRs + Helm touches per slice*
(baseline 2.3 PRs/slice, ≥2 touches/slice), stated net of *veto rate* and
*rework rate*.

exo-experiment: whole-sequence-auth — judged by *Governance Wait Ratio* and
*Autonomous Correct Completion Rate* (baseline GWR 0.40–0.60, ACCR 0%),
stated net of *escaped defect rate*.

## 2026-09-17 — DRA-161 / EXO-HARDEN-A1e: the rotated archive copies are OUT of scope for mojibake repair, permanently

**Seat:** Executor, carrying out the Planner ruling on DRA-160 (2026-09-17 09:50Z). This entry and one
paragraph added to the archive's own `README.md` are the whole change — **the three archived ledgers were
not touched; their blobs are sha-identical either side of this commit (`022fdea4`, `7eada6af`,
`fef3a1f9`), and the only file changed under `docs/ops/claude-archive/` is that README** — no transform
was run against any archived path, and the PR's `git diff --stat` shows only those two files.

**Verdict: OUT. All three files under `docs/ops/claude-archive/channels/2026-Q3/`, not now and not on the
next sweep.** The counts that raised DRA-160 are real — 56,979 cp437 depth-1 plus 14 depth-2 in
`HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md` (4,926,243 bytes, blob `fef3a1f9`), 5,429 cp1252 in the archived
`HELM-FEEDBACK.md` (1,915,606 bytes, blob `7eada6af`), 1,527 cp1252 in the archived `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md`
(1,000,117 bytes, blob `022fdea4`) — each measured off `/git/blobs/{sha}` with the decoded byte length
asserted against the tree's `size`, which is the only read that does not hit the contents-API false-clean
trap. They are real and they are not a defect to repair. **A future mojibake sweep reads this entry
instead of re-raising the card.**

### The Helm LOCK is not spent by this, and it stays live

The governing sentence is the DRA-55 Helm SIGN (2026-09-16 19:53Z), quoted here verbatim rather than
paraphrased, and re-read off the source comment during carry-out rather than trusted from the relay:

> Helm SIGN DRA-55 plan (ops PR #10). Executor owns slice 1 producer fix then slice 2 ledger repair.
> **Soft LEAVE inventing archive repair without separate Helm ruling.** BEVEL.md marker line stays.

[Helm decode / DRA-330: the relay substitution reads as **No archive repair without separate Helm ruling.**
The LOCK forbids archive repair without a separate Helm ruling. It is not a permission to repair. Readable
authority is this gloss, not the quoted comment.]

That LOCK forbids *repairing* the archive without a Helm ruling. It does not require a Helm ruling to
*decline* to repair: leaving the archive untouched is the LOCK's own default state, so this verdict
affirms the LOCK rather than lifting it. No LIVE ASK was opened and Helm's door stays unspent.

**The LOCK remains live.** Anyone who wants these files repaired later still needs a real, separate Helm
ruling. This entry neither grants one nor pre-empts one — it records why nobody should bother asking.

### Three files, three different reasons — not one bucket

**1. `HELM-FEEDBACK.original-flattened.md` — it is corrupt on purpose, and two artifacts already said so.**
It holds 56,979 of the ~57k cp437 occurrences on the card, and it exists so DRA-75's "nothing was lost"
claim can be checked **against the bytes** instead of taken on trust, and so `channel-wipe-guard`'s
ARCHIVE exemption can see the entries that moved. It is also the cp437 detector's only clean-checkout
fixture — real corrupt bytes with no git archaeology needed, as DRA-55's intake comment named it. The
archive README has said *"Do not try to read it; do not edit it"* since the day it landed. Those 56,979
markers are the exhibit, not the damage.

**2. `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` — it is a git blob carried byte-verbatim, and every marker sits inside the
verbatim region.** Byte arithmetic, re-derived during carry-out rather than copied from the ruling:
`f4af3b5f` resolves as commit `f4af3b5f5ac6dc1b06290a478278bd9d19681d90`; `HELM-FEEDBACK.md` at that
commit is blob `8e18b203fcbe42a20d255f477f386b5d283afcf2`, **1,909,798 bytes**. That blob is byte-contained
in the 1,915,606-byte archive copy **at offset 5,808, with zero bytes after it** — the archive file is
exactly `[5,808 bytes of header + recovered PR #564 entry]` + `[the f4af3b5f blob, whole]`. All 5,429
cp1252 occurrences are inside the verbatim tail; none are in the prepended part. So a repair pass edits
the verbatim region, and that breaks two live assertions: the README's own claim (L84-85) that the
recovered history is carried verbatim, and `channel-rotate.py verify`, which per README L140-143 asserts
that the archive contains the `f4af3b5f` blob verbatim. It also buys nothing — git still holds blob
`8e18b203` with all 5,429 markers intact. Repairing the copy does not repair the history; it only makes
the copy stop matching the history it exists to document.

**3. `FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` — rotation moved these bytes, it did not create them.** The pre-rotation live
`FABLE-FEEDBACK.md` at `c3a40c1e` (parent of rotation commit `8f9e3205`) is blob
`51b18b02101c5210b94892a652549872f7f9a0b2`, 1,170,568 bytes, carrying **1,527** cp1252 occurrences — the
identical count now in the 1,000,117-byte archive copy. Those bytes were already permanent in git before
the archive existed.

### The principle, stated once so the next sweep quotes it instead of re-deriving it

**A rotated archive copy is not an independent site of corruption.** Rotation is a one-way move of bytes
that are already immutable in git history. Repairing a rotated copy removes zero corruption from the
record — it only makes the archive diverge from the revisions it was cut from, and it spends the fixtures
and byte-identity assertions that were deliberately built on that sameness. Count archive markers as
*copies of* live-surface markers when scoping a sweep, never as their own findings.

Repair pays on the **live** surface, and that work is done and guarded: DRA-119 slice A (PR #657, merged
2026-09-17 07:25Z) made `channel-wipe-guard.ps1` check 4 fail CI on cp437 at both depths, and slice B
(PR #659, merged 2026-09-17 09:40Z) repaired 77 lines while preserving 4 quoted ones. Rotation is
one-way, so nothing in the archive can reach a live file. Nothing is at risk from this verdict.

### The default this could have gone the other way on

Repair all three, on the grounds that ~64k mojibake occurrences in the tree is obviously bad and the fix
is a script that already exists (`scripts/demojibake.py`). That reading counts markers instead of reading
what each file is for, and it would have destroyed a SIGNed checkability exhibit, a detector fixture, and
two byte-identity assertions in order to change nothing about how much corruption git holds. The tell is
that the archive numbers do not move the live numbers in either direction — which is what makes them the
wrong surface to measure.

## 2026-09-21 — DRA-262 D2: two calls the signed plan did not make

**1. A 2.0.0 What's-new highlight was made TRUE rather than left to ship self-contradicting.**
DRA-66's entry (still unreleased) ends *"If your achievements dump has already named your
classes, that answer wins and the room says so — run the dump again if it is out of date."*
D1 reversed the first half and D2 deletes the sentence the second half points at, so shipping
both entries would put two opposite promises about one control in one release. I struck that
one clause; the rest of the highlight is byte-identical, and the new entry carries the dump
story. **It could have gone the other way**: leave it, on the grounds that D2's declared duty
was one new entry and editing a neighbouring highlight is scope. Chosen against because
"every entry TRUE" is the standing rule and the falsehood is one my own change created.

**2. The plan's optional chip tick in the E2E was DECLINED, on a measurement.**
`SetStatedClasses` has one writer in the app — the chip's own `onClick` inside `HomeRoom` —
and the suite may not press a control. Reaching it needs a FIFTH `DebugHooks` rendezvous, and
each of the four that exist was authorized separately. The plan gated the ask on "cheaply";
this is not. **It could have gone the other way**: build the probe, on the grounds that the
plan floated it. Chosen against because a new debug rendezvous is machinery the slice did not
declare. Displacement stays proven in `CharacterClassesTests` (D1) and the E2E asserts
`shellHomeClassDoor == 1` beside `shellHomeClassChips == 0` — prove-failed by restoring the
early return: `door=0 chips=0`, red on the first half, which is what the chip count alone
could never have seen.


## 2026-09-22 — Support EQBuddy moves from landing footer to hero (Founder)

**Chosen:** keep the DRA-69 Stripe Payment Link
(`https://buy.stripe.com/aFa00k1tE2064qRb0S9R600`, new tab, text link — not an
embed) and place the quiet optional-support sentence under the hero pill row,
removing it from the footer. Guard renamed to
`LandingSourceClaimsTests.TheHeroCarriesAQuietSupportLink` (asserts hero has it
and footer does not).

**Default it could have gone the other way on:** leave it in the footer, which
is what Helm signed for DRA-69 (PR #577: footer text-weight KEEP, not hero).

**Why this way:** Founder ask to move Support EQBuddy near the top of the
landing so it is visible without scrolling, still optional community support
for a free program — not a CTA shout. Hero under the pills preferred over a
topbar nav item so it stays readable without crowding the section links.


## 2026-09-22 — Support EQBuddy copy: amount chosen on Stripe (Founder follow-up)

**Chosen:** keep the same Payment Link URL; reword the hero line so the gift is
optional voluntary support and the donor chooses any amount on Stripe's
checkout. Amount choice is a Stripe Dashboard Payment Link setting — not an
on-page picker and not a second URL.

**Default it could have gone the other way on:** leave the shorter "If this
companion is useful, you can Support EQBuddy." sentence, which never named $5
but also never said the donor picks the amount.

**Why this way:** Founder follow-up on the hero-move PR — allow a custom
donation amount, and do not imply a fixed price on the landing. Soft LEAVE
inventing a second Payment Link until Helm supplies a replacement URL.


## 2026-09-22 — Support EQBuddy is a topbar chip, not a hero paragraph (Founder)

**Chosen:** remove the hero `<p class="support">` sentence shipped in #826 and
place a quiet `nav.topbar` chip labeled Support EQBuddy at the top-right
(after GitHub). Same Payment Link URL, new tab, no embed. Guard renamed to
`LandingSourceClaimsTests.TheTopbarCarriesAQuietSupportChip` (topbar has it;
hero and footer must not).

**Default it could have gone the other way on:** keep the hero paragraph #826
just landed, which was near the top but not the top-right chip the Founder
meant.

**Why this way:** Founder feedback after #826 merged — he wanted a chip at the
top right of the page, not the hero paragraph under the pills. Soft LEAVE
inventing a second Payment Link or changing the Stripe URL.

## 2026-09-22 — Landing hero KPIs are measured counts

**Chosen:** the four tiles in the hero KPI band on `site/index.html` read, in
order, Quests Tracked, Items Cataloged, Downloads, and Max Concurrent Users.
`site/metrics.json` is the source of truth the page fetches. The `.n` text is
that same snapshot, so the band still reads when the fetch does not run.
Shipped 2026-09-22: `questsTracked` **1173** (length of the `quests` array in
`src/EQBuddy.Core/Data/QuestCatalog.json`), `itemsCataloged` **11196** (length
of the `Items` array in `src/EQBuddy.Core/Data/ItemCatalog.json.gz`),
`downloads` **28462** (sum of GitHub release asset `EQBuddySetup.exe`
`download_count` across all releases — installer downloads, not unique people),
`maxConcurrentUsers` **null**, painted as an em dash.

**How to refresh:** re-count those two arrays and write the counts into
`site/metrics.json`. Re-sum `EQBuddySetup.exe` download counts from the GitHub
releases API and write that sum into `downloads`. When opt-in telemetry
(DRA-336) publishes a max-concurrent figure, replace null with that integer.
Then set each hero `.n` to the formatted value (thousands separators; null
stays an em dash). `LandingSourceClaimsTests.TheHeroKpisAreMeasuredStats`
refuses a drift between the JSON, the catalog arrays, and the painted text,
and it refuses a concurrent integer while the value is still null.

**Default it could have gone the other way on:** leave the four principle zeros
in the band (0 game-memory reads, 0 accounts, 0 telemetry by default, 11,000+
catalog). Those sentences stay on the page outside the band — the pills and
the principles section — because they are still the product boundary.

**Why this way:** Founder ask 2026-09-22. The band is a place for counts a
reader can check. A concurrent number that telemetry has not published would
be a figure EQBuddy invented.

## 2026-09-22 — Max Concurrent Users empty state says why (Founder)

**Chosen:** while `maxConcurrentUsers` stays null, the hero tile shows "Telemetry not live yet" instead of the em dash #830 painted.

## 2026-09-23 — Support EQBuddy tip link is Ko-fi (Founder)

**Chosen:** the topbar chip labeled Support EQBuddy opens `https://ko-fi.com/eqbuddy`
in a new tab. Same placement, same label. The Stripe Payment Link is gone.
Framing stays an optional community tip for a free program — not charity,
crowdfunding, or paid access, and the label is not Donate.

**Default it could have gone the other way on:** keep the DRA-69 Stripe Payment
Link (`https://buy.stripe.com/aFa00k1tE2064qRb0S9R600`), which the 2026-09-22
entries froze.

**Why this way:** Founder ask 2026-09-23. That Payment Link is dead; Ko-fi is
the live tip URL.

## 2026-09-18 - Sky ticks: ledger-keyed auto-tick, hand-ins read from the log, runes spared on a scan

Hateborne's own report, asked in session (not an inbox item). The Plane of Sky tab ticked
High Quality Raiment and Wind Rune Meda with none of either held. Calls made, each with the
default it could have gone the other way on:

1. **Hand-in parsing was built in session, not routed through a Fable plan.** A new log
   grammar plus consumption rules reads as V2 under this file's routing; Hateborne chose to
   build it here (question tool). It is one small class (`HandInTracker`), and every exit it
   records goes through the ledger's existing replay-safe time gate.
2. **A refusal cancels the WHOLE trade.** "You can have it back" never names the item; the
   other way was guessing which item came back. The cost: a bag item stays over-counted until
   the next scan, a currency item until the player corrects it.
3. **Only `*` guesses are ever taken back**, never a tick the player made, one on a class
   they picked, or one an import proved. The other way was reconciling every tick to the count.
4. **A scan never judges a Wind Rune** (Hateborne's call, asked because it ships to every
   player). Runes store to currency since 2026-09-16 and every scan since recorded them as
   zero; `CurrencyItems` names them before the log teaches it. The other way would have
   cleared 55 of his 68 guesses, many for runes he holds. The cost: guesses left over from
   before this build need a right-click.
5. **Folds live for the RUN, on MainWindow, shared by both hosts.** The 2026-09-03 ruling says
   "session-only"; this reads session as the run (Hateborne: "across the session (but not
   across all sessions)"). The other way was one store per host. A fresh Quest Tracker also
   reopens on the last tab now (the host always kept it and nothing read it back), except
   when the map badge opens it on an item filter.
6. **Ratchet room came from dead code, not a baseline bump.** `LogParser`'s second
   `LocationRx` check could never fire: the anchored fast path returns first.

## 2026-09-25 - DRA-339: Quick Buff landings take your last own rank; buff fading chips get a switch

1. **Root cause is Quick Buff, measured in the Founder's log.** 13:37:17 on 09-22: "You
   activate Quick Buff.", every landing 3 s later, no cast line. Unresolved landings armed at
   rank I's wiki base without SCR (Thorns 900 s vs his 1,416 s). The other way was a longer
   alert floor or silencing estimated buffs; both hide the defect rather than fix it.
2. **The rank is the one your log last showed you casting for that line.** An inference, so
   it never teaches a duration (the `DumpNarrowed` gate). Other way: spellbook-dump rank.
3. **`BuffFadeChipsEnabled` defaults ON.** The Founder's authorizing comment says "default
   on, Founder wants off"; Planner's re-scope read it as default OFF. I followed the Founder's
   words: turning it off for everyone would remove a working alert from every player to
   serve one preference. Veto = flip one default.
4. **BuffWarnSeconds=10 stopgap stands down.** It was never written to any profile; with
   (1) fixed and the switch shipped, it has nothing left to cover.

## 2026-09-26 - Fork: teammates come from your own log; the teammate-file feature is retired

1. **No teammate file.** The user: "this should not require any team log file, it should
   just do everything it can from my logs". Garg's hits, kills, deaths and heals are already
   in the player's own log; `TeammatePerspective` rewrites them into Garg's first person
   and the unchanged parser feeds an isolated `SessionStats` per teammate. Other way: keep
   the file as an optional precision mode. Removed instead: `TeammateLogTail`,
   `ClockDriftEstimator`, `FileIdentity`, `TeammateLogPicker`, the duo mez path and the
   clock warning. The 2026-09-07/09-17 entries above describe that retired feature.
2. **Who counts is a whitelist.** Group join, an accepted invite and group chat, minus
   leave/remove/disband; plus names added in Options -> Behavior -> Teammates. Bystanders
   print the same line shapes, so "any player name" was never an option.
3. **A primary rollover restarts teammate totals but keeps the roster.** Group lines are
   not repeated after a quiet hour; clearing the roster would silently stop counting Garg
   after a dinner break. Other way: clear it with the session.
4. **Party-kill corrections are scoped to the PRIMARY's session** and recorded off the
   primary's own kill line, so a stale death can never eat a later real kill, and a kill
   Garg made before joining stays a party kill.
5. **Mobile shows the same combined snapshot as the desktop; history stays solo**
   (unchanged from 2026-09-17).
6. **Upstream diff shrank**: `LogWatcher.cs` is `partial` plus two lines; `SessionStats.cs`,
   `MezTracker.cs` and the ledger stores are byte-identical to upstream again;
   `MainWindow.xaml.cs` keeps five in-place lines at 4,222.
